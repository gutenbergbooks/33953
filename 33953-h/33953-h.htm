<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Book of Noblesse, which is now for the first time printed, was
  addressed to King Edward the Fourth for a political purpose, on a great
  and important occasion. He was in the midst of his second reign, living
  in high prosperity. He had subdued his domestic enemies. His Lancastrian
  rivals were no longer in existence, and the potent King-maker had fought
  his last field. Edward was the father of two sons; and had no immediate
  reason to dread either of his younger brothers, however unkind and
  treacherous we now know them to have been. He was the undisputed King of
  England, and, like his predecessors, the titular King of France. His
  brother-in-law the duke of Burgundy, who had befriended him in his exile
  in 1470, was continually urging, for his own ambitious views, that the
  English should renew their ancient enterprises in France; and Edward,
  notwithstanding his natural indolence, was at last prepared to carry his
  arms into that country. The project was popular with all those who were
  burning for military fame, indignant at the decay of the English name
  upon the continent, or desirous to improve their fortunes by the
  acquisitions of conquest. The Book of Noblesse was written to excite and
  inflame such sentiments and expectations.</p>

  <p>Its unknown author was connected with those who had formerly profited
  by the occupation of the English provinces in France, and particularly
  with the celebrated sir John Fastolfe, knight of the Garter, whom the
  writer in several places mentions as "myne autor."</p>

  <p>Sir John Fastolfe had survived the losses of his countrymen in France,
  and died at an advanced age in the year 1460. It seems not at all
  improbable that the substance of this book was written during his
  life-time, and that it was merely revised and augmented on the eve of
  Edward the Fourth's invasion of France. All the historical events which
  are mentioned in it date at least some five-and-twenty years before that
  expedition.</p>

  <p>The author commences his composition by an acknowledgment, how
  necessary it is in the beginning of every good work, to implore the grace
  of God: and then <!-- Page ii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageii"></a>{ii}</span>introduces a definition of true nobility or
  Noblesse, in the words of "Kayus' son," as he designates the younger
  Pliny.</p>

  <p>He next states that his work was suggested by the disgrace which the
  realm had sustained from the grievous loss of the kingdom of France, the
  duchies of Normandy, Gascony, and Guienne, and the counties of Maine and
  Ponthieu; which had been recovered by the French party, headed by Charles
  the Seventh, in the course of fifteen months, and chiefly during the year
  1450. To inspire a just indignation of such a reverse, he recalls all the
  ancestral glories of the English nation, from their first original in the
  ancient blood of Troy, and through all the triumphs of the Saxons, Danes,
  Normans, and Angevyns. Of the Romans in England he says nothing, though
  in his subsequent pages he draws much from Roman history.</p>

  <p>The next chapter sets forth how every man of worship in arms should
  resemble the lion in disposition, being eager, fierce, and courageous. In
  illustration of this it may be remarked, that Froissart, when describing
  the battle of Poictiers, says of the Black Prince, "The Prince of Wales,
  who was <i>as courageous and cruel as a lion</i>, took great pleasure
  this day in fighting and chasing his enemies." So our first Richard is
  still popularly known by his martial epithet of C&oelig;ur de Lyon: and
  that the lion was generally considered the fit emblem of knightly valour
  is testified by its general adoption on the heraldic shields of the
  highest ranks of feudal chivalry. The royal house of England displayed
  three lions, and the king of beasts was supposed to be peculiarly
  symbolic of their race&mdash;</p>

  <p>In the following chapter the author proceeds to describe "how the
  French party began first to offend, and break the truce." This truce had
  been concluded at Tours on the 28th of May 1444. The French are stated to
  have transgressed it first by capturing certain English merchant-men on
  the sea; and next by taking as prisoners various persons who bore
  allegiance to the English king. Of such are enumerated sir Giles son of
  the duke of Bretagne<a name="NtA1" href="#Nt1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>; sir
  Simon Morhier, the <!-- Page iii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageiii"></a>{iii}</span>provost of Paris, taken at Dieppe<a
  name="NtA2" href="#Nt2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>; one Mansel an esquire, taken
  on the road between Rouen and Dieppe, in January 1448-9<a name="NtA3"
  href="#Nt3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>; and the lord Fauconberg, taken at Pont de
  l'Arche on the 15th May 1449.<a name="NtA4"
  href="#Nt4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> The writer is careful to state that these
  acts of aggression on the part of the French, or some of them, were
  committed "before the taking of Fugiers," for it was by that action that
  the English party had really brought themselves into difficulty.<a
  name="NtA5" href="#Nt5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There is next discussed (p. <a href="#page6">6</a>) "a question of
  great charge and weight, whether it be lawful to make war upon Christian
  blood." This is determined upon the authority of a book entitled The Tree
  of Batailes, a work which had evidently already acquired considerable
  popularity whilst still circulated in manuscript only, <!-- Page iv
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiv"></a>{iv}</span>and which so far
  retained its reputation when books began to be multiplied by the
  printing-press as to be reproduced on several occasions. Our author
  frequently recurs to it, but his references do not agree with the book as
  it now remains; and it is remarkable that he attributes it, not to Honoré
  Bonnet its real author,<a name="NtA6" href="#Nt6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> but
  to one dame Christine, whom he describes (see his note in p. <a
  href="#page54">54</a>) as an inmate of the house of religious ladies at
  Passy near Paris. It would seem, therefore, that he made use of a
  somewhat different book, though probably founded on the celebrated work
  of Honoré Bonnet.</p>

  <p>The fact of wars sometimes originating from motives of mere rivalry or
  revenge prompts the writer or commentator (whose insertions I have
  distinguished as proceeding from a "second hand,") to introduce some
  remarks on the inveterate and mortal enmity that had prevailed between
  the houses of Burgundy and Orleans, which led to so many acts of cruelty
  and violence at the beginning of the fifteenth century.</p>

  <p>King Edward is next reminded "how saint Louis exhorted and counselled
  his son to move no war against Christian people;" but, notwithstanding
  that blessed king's counsel,<a name="NtA7" href="#Nt7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
  it is declared on the other hand that "it is notarily and openly <!--
  Page v --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagev"></a>{v}</span>known
  through all Christian realms that our adverse party hath moved and
  excited war and battles both by land and sea against this noble realm
  without any justice or title, and without ways of peace showed; and
  consequently it might be without note of tiranny for the king of England
  to defend (or drive away) those assailants upon his true title, and to
  put himself in devoir to conquer his rightful inheritance."</p>

  <p>The writer then bursts forth into a passionate exhortation to the
  English nation, to remember their ancient prowess, the annals of which he
  proceeds to set forth in several subsequent chapters. He enumerates the
  examples of king Arthur, of Brennus, Edmond Ironside, William the
  Conqueror, Henry the First, his brother Robert elect king of Jerusalem,
  Fulke earl of Anjou, Richard C&oelig;ur de Lyon, Philip Dieudonné of
  France, Edward the First, and Richard earl of Cornwall and emperor of
  Almaine. He rehearses how Edward the Third had the victory at the battle
  of Scluse, gat Caen by assault, won the field at the great and dolorous
  battle of Cressy, captured David king of Scots and Charles duke of
  Bretany, and took Calais by siege; how Edward prince of Wales made John
  king of France prisoner at Poictiers; and how the battle of Nazar was
  fought in Spain.</p>

  <p>In the following chapter it is related how king Henry the Fifth
  conquered Normandy; under which head a particular account is given of the
  defence of Harfleur against the power of France. Here it is that the name
  of sir John Fastolfe is first introduced as an authority, in respect to a
  circumstance of that siege, which is, that the watchmen availed
  themselves of the assistance of mastiffs&mdash;"and as for wache and ward
  yn the wynter nyghtys I herd the seyd ser Johan Fastolfe sey that every
  man kepyng the scout wache had a masty hound at a lyes (<i>or</i> leash),
  to barke and warne yff ony adverse partye were commyng to the dykes or to
  aproche the towne for to scale yt."</p>

  <p>The chapter concludes with a mention of the battle of Agincourt and
  the marriage of king Henry to the French king's daughter.</p>

  <p>The following chapters (pp. <a href="#page17">17</a> et seq.) contain
  how in the time of John duke of Bedford, who was for thirteen years
  Regent of France, the victory of Cravant was obtained by his lieutenant
  the earl of Salisbury; how the duke in his own person won the battle of
  Verneuil in Perche; how that the greater part of the county of Mayne, and
  the city of Mauns, with many other castles, were brought <!-- Page vi
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi"></a>{vi}</span>into subjection;
  and how that Henry the Sixth, by the might of great lords, was crowned
  King in Paris; after which the writer bursts forth into another
  exhortation, or "courageous recomforting" of the "valiauntnes of
  Englishemen."</p>

  <p>The author now flies off (p. <a href="#page20">20</a>) to more remote
  examples, to the noblesse of that vaillant knight Hector of Troy, to the
  deeds in arms of Agamemnon the puissaunt king of Greece, and to those of
  Ulysses and Hercules.</p>

  <p>He recites, from the book of Vegetius on Military Tactics,<a
  name="NtA8" href="#Nt8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> how a conqueror should
  especially practise three things,&mdash;the first, a scientific prudence
  or caution: the second, exercitacion and usage in deeds of arms: and the
  third, a diligent regard to the welfare of his people.</p>

  <p>He next argues how men of noblesse ought to leave sensualities and
  delights.</p>

  <p>In the following chapters (p. <a href="#page22">22</a> et seq.), he
  sets forth the King's title to the duchy of Normandy, to the inheritance
  of Anjou, Maine, and Touraine, and to the duchies of Gascoigne and
  Guienne.</p>

  <p>The "historier" proceedeth (p. <a href="#page25">25</a>) in his matter
  of exhortation, strengthening his arguments by the heterogeneous
  authority of master Alanus de Auriga, of "the clerke of eloquence
  Tullius," of Caton, the famous poet Ovid, and Walter Malexander. The work
  of the first of these authors, Alain Chartier, seems to have been at once
  the source from which many of our author's materials were derived, and
  also to have furnished the key-note upon which he endeavoured to pitch
  his <!-- Page vii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagevii"></a>{vii}</span>appeals to the patriotism and prowess of
  his countrymen. Alain Chartier<a name="NtA9"
  href="#Nt9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> had been secretary to king Charles the
  Seventh, and wrote his Quadrilogue<a name="NtA10"
  href="#Nt10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> in the year 1422, in defence of the
  native party in France, and in opposition to the English usurpation. Our
  author imitates his rhapsodical eloquence, and borrows some of his verbal
  artillery and munitions of war, whilst he turns them against the party of
  their original deviser.</p>

  <p>In the subsequent pages several anecdotes are derived from Alain
  Chartier<a name="NtA11" href="#Nt11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>; and further
  advice is drawn from the Arbre des Batailles (pp. <a
  href="#page27">27</a>, <a href="#page30">30</a>), and from the treatise
  of Vegetius (p. <a href="#page29">29</a>).</p>

  <p>It is related (p. <a href="#page33">33</a>) how king John lost the
  duchy of Normandy for lack of finaunce to wage his soldiers; and next
  follows (p. <a href="#page34">34</a>) a long and important chapter
  recounting the various truces made between the kings of England and
  France, and showing how frequently they had been broken by the French
  party, to the decay of the English power, except when revived by the
  victories of Edward the Third and Henry the Fifth. This part of the
  discussion is concluded with a representation (p. <a
  href="#page41">41</a>) of the lamentable condition of the French subjects
  of the English crown, when put out of their lands and tenements. "Heh
  allas! (thei did crie,) and woo be the tyme (they saide) that ever we
  shulde put affiaunce and trust to the Frenshe partie or theire allies in
  any trewes-keping, considering so many-folde tymes we have ben deceived
  and myschevid thoroughe suche dissimuled trewes!"</p>

  <p>Yet, notwithstanding all these discouragements, a confident trust is
  expressed that the inheritance of France will at length be brought to its
  true and right estate.</p>

  <p>The writer then proposes (p. <a href="#page41">41</a>) a question to
  be resolved by divines, How be <!-- Page viii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageviii"></a>{viii}</span>it that at some times God suffereth the
  party that hath a true title and right to be overcome, yet for all that a
  man should not be discouraged from pursuing his right. He mentions the
  last unfortunate overthrow sustained at Formigny<a name="NtA12"
  href="#Nt12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> in 1450, and the consequent loss of
  Guienne and Bordeaux.</p>

  <p>After which follows (p. <a href="#page43">43</a>) "another exhortation
  of the historier," addressed to the "highe and myghtifulle prince, king
  of Englonde and of France, and alle y<sup>e</sup> other noble princes and
  other puissaunt lordes and nobles of divers astates olde or yong."</p>

  <p>A brief recommendation ensues of the deeds in arms of that mightiful
  prince of renommee Henry the Fifth and the three full mighty and noble
  princes his brethren; where, in the commendation of Humphrey duke of
  Gloucester, the second hand has inserted a note of his "bokys yovyng, as
  yt ys seyd to the value of M<sup>l</sup> marks, of the vij sciences, of
  dyvinite, as of law spirituall and cyvyle, to the universite of
  Oxford."</p>

  <p>Allusion is made (p. <a href="#page46">46</a>) to the order of the
  Garter, "founded (as yt ys seyd) in token of worship that he being in
  bataile, what fortune fille, shulde not voide the feeld, but abide the
  fortune that God lust sende;" of which fellowship sir John Chandos,
  seneschal of Poictou, had been a right noble exemplar. The historical
  reminiscences of the author then again lead him on to the disastrous
  period during which the continental possessions of England had been lost,
  "within the space of one year and fourteen (fifteen) weeks, that is to
  wete, from the xv. day of May in the year 1449 unto the xv. day of August
  in the year 1450, that every castle, fortress, and town defensable of the
  said duchies were delivered up by force or composition to the adverse
  party."</p>

  <p>After a break (p. <a href="#page50">50</a>), in consequence of the
  loss of a leaf of the Manuscript, we find ourselves in the midst of a
  discussion of the merits of astrology. The author addresses himself to
  combat the prevalent confidence in prophecies and in the influence of the
  stars: "which judgments (he avers) be not necessarily true;" but merely
  contingent or likely, and, he adds, "as likely not to be as to be." For
  if, he puts the case, "a constellation or a prophecy signified that such
  a year or within <!-- Page ix --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageix"></a>{ix}</span>such a time there should fall war,
  pestilence, or dearth of vitaile to a country or region, or privation of
  a country, it is said but dispositively, and not of necessity or
  certainty; for then it should follow that the prophecies, constellations,
  and influence of the stars were masters over God's power, and that would
  soune to a heresy, or else to a great error." After this pious
  determination upon a question that at that period presented great
  difficulties, the author adds, that he believed God to have bestowed that
  sovereignty upon man's soul, that, having a clean soul, he might even
  turn the judgment of constellations or prophecies to the contrary
  disposition: to which effect he quotes the bold assertion of the famous
  astrologian Ptolemy,</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Quod homo sapiens dominatur astris.</i></p>

  <p>With these sentiments, rising superior to the general prejudices of
  the age, our author proceeds confidently to censure the moral causes of
  the recent calamities, which in his judgment had ensued "for lak of
  prudence and politique governaunce in dew time provided," and from
  "havyng no consideracion to the comon wele, but rather to magnifie and
  enriche one silfe by singler covetise, using to take gret rewardis and
  suffering extorcions over the pore peple." On this subject he
  subsequently speaks still more plainly.</p>

  <p>This leads him to reflect upon the fate of many realms and countries
  that had been ruined by sin and misgovernance: as the old Bretons were,
  when driven out of England by the Saxons into Cornwall and Wales. "And
  where (he exclaims<a name="NtA13" href="#Nt13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>) is
  Nynnyve, the gret cite of thre daies? and Babilon, the gret toure,
  inhabited now withe wilde bestis? the citeis of Troy and Thebes, ij.
  grete magnified citeis? also Athenes, that was the welle of connyng and
  of wisdom?" Carthage, "the victorioux cite of gret renomme," had been
  burnt to ashes by the Romans. Rome <!-- Page x --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagex"></a>{x}</span>herself had for the greater
  part been overthrown; and Jerusalem had shared the like fate.</p>

  <p>In the succeeding portions of his work the compiler takes much of his
  matter from Roman history: which he derives from the decades of Titus
  Livius, either directly, or through the medium of the "Tree of Batailes."
  Tullius and Cato are also repeatedly cited.</p>

  <p>It is unnecessary to notice here all the historical anecdotes thus
  introduced, as they will at once be seen on turning over the pages; but
  attention should be directed to one of the most remarkable passages in
  the book, in which the writer quotes the sentiments of "myne autor," sir
  John Fastolfe:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I hafe herd myne autor Fastolfe sey, when he had yong knyghtys and
  nobles at his solasse (<i>i.e.</i> tuition), how that there be twey maner
  condicions of manly men, and one ys a manlye man called, another ys a
  hardye man; but he sayd the manlye man ys more to be comended, more then
  the hardy man; for the hardy man that sodenly, bethout discrecion of gode
  avysement, avauncyth hym yn the felde to be hadde couragiouse, and wyth
  grete aventur he scapyth, voidith the felde allone, but he levyth his
  felyshyp detrussed (or disordered). And the manly man, hys policie ys
  that (if) he avaunce hym and hys felyshyp at skirmish or sodeyn
  racountre, he wulle so discretely avaunce hym that he wulle entend
  [<i>i.e.</i> be sure] to hafe the over-hand of hys adversarye, and safe
  hymself and hys felyshyp."</p>

  <p>It was thus that the experienced captain sir John Fastolfe
  distinguished between the rashly daring and those who bravely embarked on
  some feasible and well conceived exploit. It is evident that the term
  "hardy" was then sometimes understood in the sense we now call
  fool-hardy.<a name="NtA14" href="#Nt14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> The author
  himself uses the word "fool-hardiesse" in p. <a
  href="#page63">63</a>.</p>

<p><!-- Page xi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexi"></a>{xi}</span></p>

  <p>At p. <a href="#page68">68</a> will be found another anecdote of sir
  John Fastolfe. It shows that the writer had access to those books of
  accompt which sir John had kept when a captain in France. "I fynde (he
  says) by his bookes of hys purveonds how yn every castell, forteresse,
  and cyte or towne, he wolde hafe grete providence of vitaille, of cornys,
  of larde, and beoffes, of stok physsh and saltfysh owt of England commyng
  by shyppes." It was because of his good management in this respect that
  the regent and lords of the council intrusted so many castles to his
  custody that he yearly had under his command three hundred spears (or
  mounted men-at-arms) with their attendants. Also in like manner he
  purveyed yearly for his soldiers a livery of red and white; and
  equipments sufficient for any naked man that was able to do the king and
  regent service. The good result of this provision was manifested on a
  memorable occasion, when the duke of Exeter was captain of the city of
  Paris, and Fastolfe captain of the bastille of St. Anthoine. It happened,
  in consequence of the arrest of the lord de Lisle Adam,<a name="NtA15"
  href="#Nt15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> a favourite with the commons of the
  city, that they suddenly took arms, and rebelled against the duke of
  Exeter, who found it necessary to repair to the bastille for his defence.
  <!-- Page xii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexii"></a>{xii}</span>At his coming the first question he asked
  of Fastolfe was how far he was furnished with corn, with wheat, beans,
  peasen, and aveyn for horse-meat, and with other vitail. Fastolfe
  replied, With sufficient for a half-year or more: which gave the prince
  great "comfort," or re-assurance. So he made ready his ordnance, and
  discharged the great guns amongst the rebels, with mighty shot of arrows:
  by which means, and because the French king and queen, who were in the
  city, also held against the rebels, the burgesses were in a short time
  constrained to submit to the mercy of the duke of Exeter.<a name="NtA16"
  href="#Nt16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

  <p>At p. <a href="#page69">69</a> occurs a curious chapter in the praise
  of agriculture, or "labourage of the londe" as it is there termed,
  illustrated by a description of the gardens and herbers of king
  Cyrus.</p>

  <p>But the most important portion of the whole work, in an historical
  point of view, is the chapter commencing at p. <a href="#page71">71</a>,
  intended to inforce the wisdom and necessity of making just pay to
  soldiers, for eschewing of great inconveniences that may otherwise insue.
  It is here admitted that in this respect there had been more neglect in
  the English possessions in France than was elsewhere known<a name="NtA17"
  href="#Nt17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>: <!-- Page xiii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiii"></a>{xiii}</span>that in consequence
  the people had suffered great oppression from the soldiers taking their
  vitail without payment, and that such abuses had continued unchecked for
  ten or twelve years previously to the country being lost. Our author
  advises that the chieftains and captains should be duly paid their wages,
  either monthly, as had been usual during the time of the regent Bedford,
  or quarterly, and that without any reward of courtesy, bribe,
  defalcation, or abridgment, or any undue assignation; and that such
  payments be made content without delay, or long and great pursuit. It
  appears from the writer's statements, that the royal officers, deputies,
  and commissioners had not only been guilty of the practices thus
  denounced, but that those officers themselves had been needlessly
  numerous, living as they did upon bribery and extortion, and neglecting
  the exercise of arms necessary for the defence and protection of the
  territory. Oftentimes they had wasted of the subjects'<a name="NtA18"
  href="#Nt18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> livelode more than was necessary, and
  oftentimes had suffered them to be menaced and beaten, and mischieved
  their beasts with their weapons, so that they were nigh out of their wits
  for sorrow, and thus enforced "for duresse" to forsake the title and laws
  of their English sovereign. Moreover, they had been so often grievously
  surcharged with paying of tasques, tails (or tolls), subsidies, and
  impositions, besides their rents paid either to the crown or their
  landlords, and many of them dwelling upon the marches having also patised
  (or compounded?) to the adverse party in order to dwell in rest, that
  these innumerable charges and divers torments had effected their
  uttermost undoing. The author cannot quit these reflections without this
  passionate appeal to the Almighty: "Oh God! which art most mercifulle and
  highest juge, soverein and just, how maist thou long suffre this (misery)
  regnyng without the stroke of vengeaunce and ponisshement commyng upon
  the depryvyng or yelding up of that Dukedom?"</p>

  <p>The next chapter (p. <a href="#page74">74</a>) appears to intimate
  that the writer personally sympathised in the degradation of the clergy.
  "Moreover, (he exclaims,) in way of gret pitee, and in the worship of
  God, suffre ye not the prelates of the Chirche of that lande, as
  archebisshoppis, bisshoppis, abbatis, priours, denes, archedenes, and
  their ministrours, to be oppressid, revaled, ne vileyned, as in your
  predecessour's <!-- Page xiv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexiv"></a>{xiv}</span>daies they have been accepted in fulle
  litelle reverence or obedience;" having as he alleges been privily
  coerced to give to the rulers, governors, and masters of the marches and
  countries great fees, wages, and rewards, for permission to live at rest
  upon their livelodes. And oftentimes they were visited by strangers of
  great estate, both spiritual and temporal, and particularly by those
  intrusted with the administration of the laws, besides other needless
  people that wasted and surcharged them, an exaction beyond the intent of
  their foundation, which was merely to maintain their appointed numbers,
  praying for their founders, and to feed the poor and needy in case of
  necessity.</p>

  <p>The following chapter (p. <a href="#page76">76</a>) is a remarkable
  one in respect to ancient chivalric usages. It sets forth "How lordis
  sonnes and noble men of birthe, for the defense of her londe, shulde
  exercise hem in armes lernyng." It is urged that "the sonnes of princes,
  of lordis, and for the most part of alle tho that ben comen and descendid
  of noble bloode, as of auncien knightis, esquiers, and other auncient
  gentille men, while they ben of grene age, (should be) drawen forthe,
  norisshed, and excercised in disciplines, doctrine, and usage of scole of
  armes, as using justis, to renne with speer, handle withe ax, sworde,
  dagger, and alle othir defensible wepyn, to wrestling, to skeping,
  leping, and rennyng, to make hem hardie, deliver, and wele brethed;" ...
  "and not to be unkonnyng, abashed, ne astonied for to take entrepresis,
  to answer or deliver a gentilman that desires in worship to doo armes in
  liestis, (either) to the utteraunce or to certein pointis, or in a
  quarelle rightful to fight," or in time of war to defend their sovereign
  and his realm. Such was the ancient custom of the kings both of France
  and of England: as especially of king Edward the Third, and of Henry duke
  of Lancaster. That chivalrous knight, who was accounted "a chief auctour
  and foundour in law of armes," had (as the writer was told by sir John
  Fastolfe) sent to him from princes and lords of strange regions, as out
  of Spain, Aragon, Portugal, Navarre, and France, their children, young
  knights, "to be doctrined, lerned, and brought up in his noble court, in
  scole of armes, and for to see noblesse, curtesie, and worship."</p>

  <p>This useful custom had been maintained by other noble princes and
  lords of great birth; but now of late days, (continues our author,) the
  greater pity is! many that be descended of noble blood and born to arms,
  as the sons of knights and esquires and of other gentle blood, set
  themselves to "singuler practik" and to "straunge facultees," as to learn
  "the practique of law or custom of lands, or of civil matier," and so
  waste greatly their time in such needless business, as to undertake the
  holding of manorial courts, to keep and bear out a proud <!-- Page xv
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexv"></a>{xv}</span>countenance at
  the holding of sessions and shire-motes,<a name="NtA19"
  href="#Nt19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> and "there to embrace<a name="NtA20"
  href="#Nt20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> and rule among youre pore and symple
  comyns of bestialle contenaunce that lust to lyve in rest." And it is
  added, that whoever could put himself forward as a ruler in such matters,
  was, "as the worlde goithe now," more esteemed among all estates than he
  who had expended thirty or forty years of his life in great jeopardies in
  the conquests and wars of his sovereign. The author pursues the argument
  at greater length, as the reader will find, and expresses his decided
  opinion that the high-born personages in question should rather learn to
  be good men of arms, chieftains, or captains in the field, than to be a
  captain or ruler at a sessions or shire-day; leaving such matters to the
  king's justices and officers,<a name="NtA21"
  href="#Nt21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> and that "suche singuler practik shulde
  not be accustumed and occupied undewly with suche men that be come of
  noble birthe,"&mdash;except (it is added on second thoughts) he be the
  younger brother, having not whereof to live honestly.</p>

  <p>The following chapter (p. <a href="#page78">78</a>) discusses "How
  officers of the law shulde be <!-- Page xvi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexvi"></a>{xvi}</span>chosen, welle disposid and temperate men,
  vertuous in condicion, and they to be protectid by lordis and noble men
  of birthe." There is nothing however in this chapter so remarkable as in
  that which has preceded.</p>

  <p>The author next shows (p. <a href="#page79">79</a>) "How over gret
  cost and pomp in clothing shulde be eschewed;" in which respect he
  asserts that in France "alle costius arraiementis of clothing, garmentis,
  and bobauncees, and the usaige of pellure and furres they have
  expresselie put away:" whilst in England the like "costues arraymentis
  and disguising of clothing, of so many divers facion," had caused
  impoverishing of the land, and excited great pride, envy, and wrath
  amongst the people.</p>

  <p>Whether this was truly a national grievance may be doubted. It is,
  however, more probable that the "pore comyns" of England had really
  suffered, as set forth in the succeeding chapter (p. <a
  href="#page80">80</a>), "gret hurt and inconvenientis because the
  creditours have not been duelie paid of here lonys and prestis made to
  high sovereins." This, it is stated, had been oftentimes the case in the
  reign of Henry the Sixth. They had advanced loans, "prests of vitails and
  other merchandise," of which the payment was so long delayed that great
  part of their property was previously expended, and they were sometimes
  fain to defalke and release part of their dues, in order to recover the
  rest. As an alternative for this inconvenience the writer recommends a
  course that would scarcely have proved more efficacious. "Let your riche
  tresours (he advises the king) be spradde and put abrode, both juellis
  (and) vesselle of golde and silver, among youre true subgettis, and
  inespecialle to the helpe and avauncement of youre conquest, and to the
  relief of your indigent and nedie peple, and inespecialle to tho that
  have lost theire londis, livelode, and goode in the werres, so that the
  saide tresoure may be put forthe, and late it be set in money to the
  remedie and socoure of this gret importunyte and necessite, and to the
  defens of youre roiaume from your adversaries."</p>

  <p>In another chapter (p. <a href="#page81">81</a>), having recommended
  the king, "after the blessed counceile of Saint Louis," to cherish and
  favour the good cities and towns, the author pursues the former argument
  of raising supplies, urgently exhorting all classes to strain their
  utmost for that object. "Youre saide citesins and burgeis and good comyns
  if they be tendred shalbe of power and of good courage, and wille withe
  here bodies and goodes largelie depart to be yoven for to resist the
  adversaries." Those who had not able bodies nor usage in arms, were yet
  to come forth with a good courage, spiritual men as well as temporal,
  and, as true Englishmen should do, "every man put forthe of his goodes
  after that his power is."</p>

  <p>With this strain the Epistle terminates, its last chapter (p. <a
  href="#page83">83</a>) being an illustration of the same argument from
  the <i>Punica bella</i> of Titus Livius, consisting of <!-- Page xvii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexvii"></a>{xvii}</span>"A noble
  history of the largesse of Romaynys, how amplye they departed ther godes
  yn a tym of urgent necessite, to make an armee yn to the contree of
  Auffrique."</p>

  <p>These final passages of the book, which so urgently recommend a
  voluntary contribution in aid of the intended war, were certainly written
  in the year 1475, with which date the whole composition concludes: for it
  is recorded by the historians of the day that it was on this occasion
  that king Edward the Fourth, after he had already raised all the supplies
  he could obtain by the ordinary methods of taxation, adopted the new
  device of a contribution nominally voluntary and its amount optional, and
  therefore termed a Benevolence,<a name="NtA22"
  href="#Nt22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> but which eventually, when repeated, was
  regarded with peculiar repugnance and discontent.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>After this review of the contents of the Work, we will proceed to
  notice the circumstances of the occasion for which it was professedly
  composed.</p>

  <p>The English invasion of France in the year 1475 originated in the
  events of 1470 and 1471. The temporary deposition of Edward the Fourth
  from his throne had been abetted by the aid which the King-making earl of
  Warwick derived from that forger of all mischief Louis the Eleventh of
  France. At that time Edward took refuge with his brother-in-law the duke
  of Burgundy, a man as ambitious of aggrandisement as king Louis, but
  whose disposition instigated him to pursue it by the more ordinary path
  of martial enterprise. His enmity to the king of France was bitter and
  inveterate; and it doubtless formed the topic of much of his discourse
  with the exiled English monarch. Edward, on his part, vowed an ample
  revenge when the forces of England should be again at his command: and
  the result was a mutual understanding between these princes to prosecute
  their common quarrel at the earliest opportunity.</p>

  <p>Having this object in view, Edward summoned a parliament<a
  name="NtA23" href="#Nt23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> in the autumn <!-- Page
  xviii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexviii"></a>{xviii}</span>of
  1472, in order to obtain the requisite supplies; and on the last day of
  November an act was passed whereby the commons granted to the king a
  force of 13,000 archers (the like number which had been granted to his
  predecessor in the 31st year of his reign<a name="NtA24"
  href="#Nt24"><sup>[24]</sup></a>), assigning as their motives for so
  doing, that "for the wele and suerte of this your reame inward, and the
  defence of the same outeward, to assiste youre roiall astate, ye verraily
  entendyng, in youre princely and knightly corage, with all diligence to
  youre highnes possible, all your bodely ease leyde apart, to resiste the
  seid confedered malice of youre and oure seide ennemyes, in setting
  outeward a myghty armee, able by the helpe of God to resiste the seid
  ennemyes." The archers were to abide in the king's service by the space
  of a year, each receiving the pay of six pence a day; and the commons
  granted for their support a disme, or tenth part of the income from
  lands, tenements, and possessions of every temporal person, not being a
  lord of parliament: but, if the said army held not before the feast of
  Saint Michael in 1473, the grant was to be void, and the money repaid. <a
  name="NtA25" href="#Nt25"><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The lords spiritual and temporal made a similar grant, on the
  consideration "that the kyng oure soverayn lord is disposed by the grace
  of God in his owne persone to passe forth of this his seid reame with an
  armee roiall, for the saufegarde of the same reame, and the subduyng of
  the auncien ennemyes of hym and of his seid reame."<a name="NtA26"
  href="#Nt26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> In the next session, on the 8th April
  1473, the commons granted to the king a fifteenth and a tenth, because,
  among other causes, "that ye verraily entend, as we understond, to aredye
  youre self, by all measnes to you possible, in youre moost noble persone
  to goo, departe, and passe with an arme roiall to the parties outward, to
  subdue by the myght of God youre and oure auncien enemyes, to the weele
  of you and prosperite of this youre reame."<a name="NtA27"
  href="#Nt27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Notwithstanding these earnest intentions and costly preparations, the
  season of 1473 wore away without any embarkation for France; and, at the
  close of the session on the 1st of February 1473-4, the chancellor, by
  the king's command, informed the commons that the parliament was
  prorogued to the 9th of May following,<a name="NtA28"
  href="#Nt28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> "because in the matter of foreign war
  the king was not certainly <!-- Page xix --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexix"></a>{xix}</span>informed of the disposition of his brother
  of Burgundy, and on that account he had lately sent his ambassadors to
  his said brother."</p>

  <p>The treaty with Burgundy was concluded in July 1474. The principal
  documents<a name="NtA29" href="#Nt29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> respecting it
  bear date on the 25th of that month, on which day they were ratified both
  by king Edward and duke Charles. The former undertook to land in
  Normandy, or in other parts of France, with more than ten thousand men,
  before the 1st of July following (<i>i.e.</i> 1475); and the latter
  agreed to support the king's part in person and with his forces, in order
  to accomplish the recovery of the duchies of Normandy and Aquitaine, and
  the kingdom and crown of France, from Louis, then unjustly occupying
  them. The king engaged not to treat with Louis, without the consent of
  the duke of Burgundy; and the duke in like manner covenanted not to treat
  with him without the consent of king Edward. Henceforth Louis was to be
  deemed and proclaimed their common enemy.</p>

  <p>By further articles, dated on the next following day, the contracting
  parties agreed that, when either of them waged war, they should have
  liberty to demand from the other aid to the amount of six thousand armed
  men; which were to be paid at the expense of the party requiring them,
  unless the war were in his own defence, in which case he was to pay only
  three fifths, and the other party two fifths of the soldiers' wages. By a
  further treaty, also dated on the 26th July 1474, king Edward ceded to
  the duke of Burgundy the duchy of Barr, the counties of Champagne,
  Nevers, Rethelle, Eu, and Guise, the barony of Douzi, the cities of
  Tournay and Lingon, with their dependencies, the castle and town of
  Picquigny, all the towns and lordships on either side the Somme before
  pledged to him, and further all the lands and lordships then possessed by
  Louis de <!-- Page xx --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexx"></a>{xx}</span>Luxemburgh count of St. Paul: retaining no
  feudal sovereignty over the same, but conceding that the duke and his
  successors should in future be esteemed as the sovereign princes thereof.
  It was further agreed that Edward should be crowned and anointed king of
  France at Rheims, notwithstanding that the county of Champagne was ceded
  to the duke of Burgundy.</p>

  <p>From this time the whole military population of England made constant
  and earnest preparation for hostilities. They were retained by indenture
  to serve the king for a whole year in his duchy of Normandy and realm of
  France, each receiving the wages assigned to their respective ranks.
  These were,&mdash;to a Duke xiij s. iiij d. by the day, to an Earl vj s.
  viij d., to a Baron or Banneret iiij s., to a Knight ij s., to a Man at
  Arms xij d. by the day and vj d. more as of reward, and to an Archer vj
  d. by the day.<a name="NtA30" href="#Nt30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page xxi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxi"></a>{xxi}</span></p>

  <p>In December proclamations were made throughout England for all bowyers
  and fletchers to pursue their labours with the utmost haste and
  diligence, the latter to make only "shefe arrowes;" and purveyors were
  sent into several circuits to superintend the delivery of their
  supplies.<a name="NtA31" href="#Nt31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> Other
  commissions were issued for impressing into the king's service
  carpenters, wheelers, cartwrights, masons, smiths, plumbers, and other
  artificers; and also for taking all ships of the burden of sixteen tons
  and upwards, for the transport of the army.<a name="NtA32"
  href="#Nt32"><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

  <p>For all these expenses the large sums already voted by the lords and
  commons in parliament, together with those granted by the clergy in their
  convocation, were not sufficient. It was then that recourse was had to
  the collections called Benevolences, to which allusion has been already
  made, from their being so strongly advocated by the author of The Boke of
  Noblesse. The process by which they were first brought into operation is
  thus described by Fabyan the London chronicler:</p>

  <p>"He sent for the mayer of London and his brethren the aldermen, and
  them severally examined and exorted to ayde and assyst hym towarde the
  sayd great journaye; of whiche the maier (Robert Drope, draper,) for his
  parte granted xxxli. and the aldermen some xx marke, and the leest xli.
  And that done he sent for all the thryfty commoners within the sayd
  cytie, and theym exortyd in lyke maner, whiche for the more partye
  granted to hym the wages of halfe a man for a yere, the whiche amounted
  to iiijli. xjs. iijd. And after that he rode about the more part of the
  lande, and used the people in suche fayre maner, that he reysed therby
  notable summes of money, the whiche way of the levyinge of this money was
  after named a Benevolence."</p>

  <p>"But here (adds the chronicler Hall on this subject) I wil not let
  passe a prety conceyt that happened in this gathering, in the which you
  shall not onely note the humilitie of a kyng, but more the fantasie of a
  woman. Kyng Edward had called before hym a wydow, muche aboundynge in
  substance, and no lesse grown in yeres, of whome he merely demaunded what
  she gladly woulde geve him towarde his greate charges. By my treuth,
  (quod she,) for thy lovely countenance thou shalt have even xxl. The
  kyng, lokyng scarce for the halfe of that summe, <!-- Page xxii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxii"></a>{xxii}</span>thanked her, and
  lovingly kyst her. Whether the flavor of his brethe did so comfort her
  stommacke, or she estemed the kysse of a kynge so precious a juell, she
  swore incontinently that he should have xxl. more, which she with the
  same will payed that she offered it.</p>

  <p>"The kynge, willing to shew that this benefite was to hym much
  acceptable, and not worthy to be put in oblivion, called this graunt of
  money a Benevolence, notwithstanding that many with grudge and
  malevolence gave great summes toward that new-founde Benevolence. But the
  using of such gentill fashions toward them, wyth frendly prayer of their
  assistance in his necessitie, so tempted theim, that they could not
  otherwise do, but frankely and frely yelde and geve hym a reasonable
  reward."</p>

  <p>In the spring of 1475 the season for the campaign had at length
  arrived; and on the 1st of May proclamation was made that all "the lordes
  and capitaignes" who were retained for the army should muster at
  Portsdown in the county of Southampton on the 26th of the same month.<a
  name="NtA33" href="#Nt33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> John lord Dynham, by
  letters patent dated the 15th of April, was appointed to conduct the army
  across the sea.<a name="NtA34" href="#Nt34"><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The transport of the army to Calais occupied the greater part of the
  month of June. The king, having left London on the 4th of that month,<a
  name="NtA35" href="#Nt35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> proceeded towards the coast
  through the county of Kent. On the 6th and 10th he was at Canterbury, and
  on the 20th at Sandwich, where on that day he made his will,<a
  name="NtA36" href="#Nt36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> and executed the
  instruments by which he constituted his son Edward prince of Wales to be
  Custos and Lieutenant of the kingdom during his absence.<a name="NtA37"
  href="#Nt37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> There was still some further delay, and
  the king appears not to have crossed the channel until the 4th of July,<a
  name="NtA38" href="#Nt38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> just one month after his
  quitting London.</p>

  <p>The king was accompanied in this expedition by his two brothers, the
  dukes of Clarence and Gloucester, by the dukes of Suffolk and Norfolk,
  the marquess of <!-- Page xxiii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxiii"></a>{xxiii}</span>Dorset, the earls of Northumberland,
  Rivers, and Pembroke, the earl of Ormond, the earl of Douglas, and lord
  Boyd, the barons Grey of Ruthyn, Scrope, Grey of Codnor, Stanley,
  Hastings, Ferrers, Howard, Lisle, and probably others<a name="NtA39"
  href="#Nt39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>; together with a long train of knights,
  among whom were sir Thomas Mountgomery and sir Ralph Hastings bannerets
  and knights for the king's body, sir John Astley a banneret, sir John
  Parre a knight for the body, sir William Parre, and sir Richard
  Tunstall.</p>

  <p>When the king had landed at Calais his sister the duchess of Burgundy
  came thither to welcome him, on the 6th of July. She was followed by the
  duke her husband on the 14th; at which time the duchess was at St. Omer's
  with her brothers the dukes of Clarence and Gloucester. On the 18th the
  sovereigns of England and Burgundy went together to the castle of
  Guisnes, where the duke was entertained at king Edward's expense, as he
  had been at Calais.<a name="NtA40" href="#Nt40"><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p><!-- Page xxiv --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxiv"></a>{xxiv}</span></p>

  <p>Meanwhile, (relates Molinet,) "the army spread itself through the
  neighbouring countries, numbering about twenty-two thousand men in the
  king's pay, of which the archers were badly mounted, and little used to
  go on horseback. The English were then inflated with high expectations,
  and thought that France might well tremble before them. They brought a
  new engine of artillery in the form of a carriage, which required, to put
  it in action, more than fifty horses, and it was calculated to make at
  every stroke breaches both deep and wide. Many of the English, who were
  natives of the duchies of Guienne and Normandy, brought with them the
  deeds of purchase, and registrations duly sealed, of the inheritances and
  rents that they used to possess in those duchies before their expulsion,
  looking forward to recover their title and enjoyment thereof.</p>

  <p>"The king (continues the same chronicler) drew his army towards
  Fauquenbergh, where he raised the richest tent ever seen; then he moved
  on Rousseauville, and stayed for two nights in the place where king
  Henry, the father of his predecessor, had obtained a glorious victory
  over the French, in the year 1415&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> at Agincourt; from
  thence he marched to Blangy, and from Blangy towards Peronne. Supplies
  came to his army from the countries and lordships of the duke of
  Burgundy. The English repeatedly passed and repassed the river Somme; and
  the duke of Burgundy, in person departing from Valenciennes, (where he
  had been honourably received, and where many pageants had been exhibited
  and performed before him in compliment to the king of England and
  himself,) came to view the army of the English, whom he caused to march
  and countermarch at his orders, to show his desire to lead them. The duke
  and king Edward, who then kept the field, held a conference for the space
  of three hours. A dove was observed to remain on the king's tent for a
  whole day and a half<a name="NtA41" href="#Nt41"><sup>[41]</sup></a>: and
  after its departure there <!-- Page xxv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxv"></a>{xxv}</span>followed a terrible thunder-storm, which
  did great damage to the army, by the hail stones which fell, as large as
  walnuts. From that day forward the English were in trouble enough, and
  began to murmur, saying that the king had kept badly the promises that
  had been made to them. The time passed away without anything being
  accomplished. The duke of Burgundy parted from them, and went to
  Lorraine, where he had left part of his forces, to conquer the duchy and
  county of Vaudemont."</p>

  <p>Our own historians have not discoursed at any length of the campaign
  made in France on this occasion. It has not offered to them the
  attractions of a Creci, a Poictiers, or an Agincourt; nor even presented
  any minor achievement that might have inspired their eloquence or
  stimulated their researches. Its laurels in fact withered under the wily
  diplomacy of Louis the Eleventh; and, besides the chapter of Molinet from
  which the preceding passages have been taken, it is in the pages of that
  monarch's vivid biographer, Philippe de Commines, that we are most fully
  informed of its transactions. Its results were entirely in correspondence
  with the personal characteristics of the three sovereigns concerned. The
  obstinate self-will of Charles the Rash, the luxurious indolence of king
  Edward, and the timid but crafty time-serving of Louis the Eleventh, all
  contributed to work out their natural effects.</p>

  <p>When the English began to land in France, the duke of Burgundy,
  already engaged in warfare with the German princes, was besieging the
  town of Neuss, upon the Rhine; and, until he could effect his object
  there, he would not be persuaded to leave the spot, although other
  projects of far greater political importance were now at stake. Commines
  states that "the lord Scales (meaning Anthony then earl Rivers, the
  king's brother-in-law,) was sent twice, with several other ambassadors,
  to the duke<a name="NtA42" href="#Nt42"><sup>[42]</sup></a>; but the duke
  was perverse, as if God Almighty had infatuated his senses and
  understanding; for all his life long he had been labouring to get the
  English over to invade France, and now, when they were ready, and all
  things prepared to receive them both in Bretagne and elsewhere, he
  obstinately persisted in an enterprise in which it was impossible for him
  to succeed."</p>

<p><!-- Page xxvi --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxvi"></a>{xxvi}</span></p>

  <p>There was an apostolic legate at that time with the emperor, and the
  king of Denmark was quartered in the same neighbourhood, and they both
  endeavoured to negociate a peace, by which means the duke of Burgundy
  might, if he would, have had honourable terms, and thus have been free to
  join the king of England, but he would not accept their overtures. To the
  English he excused himself as plausibly as he could, telling them that
  his honour was engaged, and it would be a lessening to his reputation to
  raise the siege of Neuss, with other like excuses. "The Englishmen (adds
  the historian) were not the same who had flourished in his father's days,
  and had conducted themselves with so much valour and skill in the old
  wars with France; but these were all raw soldiers, utterly unacquainted
  with French affairs; so that the duke acted very unwisely, if he had any
  design to make a future use of them, for in that case he ought to have
  led them on, as it were step by step, at least during the first
  campaign."</p>

  <p>The earliest bad consequence that resulted to the duke of Burgundy
  from his lingering at the seige of Neuss, was the loss of the three towns
  of Montdidier, Roye, and Corbie, which were taken by the king of France,
  shortly after the termination of his truce with Burgundy, which expired
  on the 1st of May 1475. Still the duke would not quit the siege of Neuss
  before the 13th of June.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile, king Edward landed at Calais. His army is described
  by Commines as "the most numerous, the best mounted, and the best
  equipped, that ever any king of England had invaded France withal. He was
  attended by all the lords of England, with few exceptions. He had 1500
  men of arms, richly accoutred after the French fashion, well mounted, and
  most of them barded,<a name="NtA43" href="#Nt43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> and
  every one of them had several persons on horseback in his retinue. The
  archers were 15,000, all on horseback; besides a great number of footmen,
  and others to pitch the tents and pavilions, take care of the artillery,
  and inclose the camp; and there was not one varlet in the whole army.
  There was besides a body of 3000 men who were to be landed in
  Bretagne."</p>

  <p>After these particulars, Commines repeats his censures of the duke of
  Burgundy's infatuated conduct, in throwing away that advantage of English
  aid, which he had been labouring all his life to procure. He ought (it is
  remarked) to have known that it was necessary for him to have made at
  least one campaign with the English, in order to have instructed them in
  the method of the French wars; for, though no nation is more raw or
  undisciplined than the English on their first coming over, yet a little
  time makes them excellent soldiers, equally brave and skilful. But the
  duke's conduct was just the reverse; and, among other <!-- Page xxvii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxvii"></a>{xxvii}</span>disadvantages which ensued, the season
  was almost lost, and his own army so worn out and diminished, that he was
  ashamed they should be seen, for he had lost before Neuss 4000 of his
  soldiers, the very flower of his army.</p>

  <p>The English were, however, assisted in the transport of their horses
  by the duke of Burgundy providing them five hundred flat-bottomed vessels
  of Holland and Zeeland; yet, notwithstanding that large number, and all
  the vessels king Edward could procure from his own ports, the passage of
  his forces occupied more than three weeks: "from whence one may observe
  (remarks Commines) with what amazing difficulty the kings of England
  transport their armies into France; and, if the king of France had
  understood maritime affairs as well as he did those of the land, king
  Edward would never have crossed over, at least that year; but king Louis
  had no skill in naval matters, and those to whom he committed his
  authority knew less of them than himself; yet one of our men-of-war,
  belonging to Eu, took two or three of their transports.</p>

  <p>"Before the king of England embarked from Dover, he sent one of his
  heralds, named Garter, who was a native of Normandy,<a name="NtA44"
  href="#Nt44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> to the king of France, with a letter of
  defiance, written in such an elegant style, and in such polite language,
  that I can scarcely believe any Englishman indited it. The contents were,
  that our king should surrender France to the king of England, as his
  right and inheritance, to the end that he might restore the church, the
  nobility, and the people to their ancient liberty, and relieve them from
  the great oppression and burthens they groaned under; and, if king Louis
  refused, it was declared that all the ensuing miseries and calamities
  would lie at his door, according to the forms usual upon such
  occasions.</p>

  <p>"The king of France read the letter to himself, and then, withdrawing
  into another room, commanded the herald to be called in; to whom he
  said,&mdash;I am very sensible that your master has not made this
  invasion of his own seeking, but at the importunity of the duke of
  Burgundy and the commons of England. He then remarked that the season was
  visibly far spent, and that the duke of Burgundy <!-- Page xxviii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxviii"></a>{xxviii}</span>had
  returned from Neuss in so weak and miserable a condition, that he would
  not be in a capacity to assist the invaders; that, as to the constable,<a
  name="NtA45" href="#Nt45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> he was satisfied he held
  intelligence with the king of England, who had married his niece,<a
  name="NtA46" href="#Nt46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> but there was no confidence
  to be reposed in him, for he would deceive king Edward, as he had often
  deceived himself; and, after enumerating the favours which he had
  conferred upon him, Louis added, 'His plan is to live in eternal
  dissimulation, to traffic with everybody, and to make his advantage of
  all.' Besides these, the king used several other arguments to induce the
  herald to persuade his master to an accommodation with him, giving him
  300 crowns with his own hand, and promising him 1000 more upon the
  conclusion of the peace; and afterwards, in public, his majesty ordered
  him to be rewarded with a fine piece of crimson velvet, thirty ells in
  length.</p>

  <p>"The herald replied, that, according to his capacity, he would
  contribute all that lay in his power towards a peace, and he believed his
  master would be glad to entertain the proposal; but nothing could be done
  until he was landed in France, and then, if king Louis pleased, he might
  send a herald to desire a passport for his ambassadors, if he had a mind
  to send any to king Edward; but withal Garter desired the king to address
  letters to the lords Howard or Stanley,<a name="NtA47"
  href="#Nt47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> and also to himself, that he might
  introduce the French herald.</p>

  <p>"There was a host of people attending outside during the king's
  private discourse with the herald, all of them impatient to hear what the
  king would say, and to see how his majesty looked when he came forth.
  When he had done, (continues Commines,) he called me, and charged me to
  entertain the herald till he <!-- Page xxix --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxix"></a>{xxix}</span>ordered him an escort, that I might keep
  him from talking privately with anybody; he commanded me likewise to give
  him a piece of crimson velvet of thirty ells, which I did. After which
  the king addressed himself to the rest of the company, giving them an
  account of the letters of defiance; and, having called seven or eight of
  them apart, he ordered the letters to be read aloud, showing himself very
  cheerful and valiant, without the least sign of fear in the world; for
  indeed he was much revived by what he had learned from the herald."</p>

  <p>When the duke of Burgundy first came to wait on the king of England at
  Calais, he was attended only by a small retinue,<a name="NtA48"
  href="#Nt48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> having dismissed his army into the
  countries of Barrois and Lorraine to plunder and refresh themselves (the
  duke of Lorraine having declared himself his enemy). The English had
  expected him to have joined them at their landing with at least 2500 men
  at arms, well provided, and a considerable body of horse and foot; and
  that he should have opened the campaign in France three months before
  their descent, when they might have found king Louis already harassed
  with the war and in great distress.</p>

  <p>King Edward (by the stages already described from Molinet,) marched to
  Peronne, a town belonging to the duke of Burgundy. The English, however,
  except in small companies, were not received within its gates, but they
  formed their encampment in the adjacent fields.<a name="NtA49"
  href="#Nt49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> At this place a messenger arrived from
  the constable of France, bringing letters both for the duke and the
  king.<a name="NtA50" href="#Nt50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> To the former he
  made strong professions of friendship and service, declaring that he
  would assist him and his allies, and particularly the king of England,
  against all persons and princes whatever. In his letter to king Edward he
  referred his good-meaning to the duke of Burgundy's testimony. The duke
  communicated also to the king the contents of his own letter from the
  constable, somewhat exaggerating them, and assuring Edward that the
  constable would receive him into the town of St. Quentin, and all the
  other towns under his control; and king Edward really believed it,
  because he had married the constable's niece, and he thought him so
  terribly afraid of the king of France, that he would not venture to break
  his promise to the duke and himself. Nor was the duke of Burgundy less
  credulous than king Edward. <!-- Page xxx --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxx"></a>{xxx}</span>But neither the perplexities of the
  constable, nor his dread of the king of France, had as yet carried him so
  far; his design was only to wheedle and amuse them (according to his
  custom), and suggest to them such plausible reasons as might prevail with
  them not to force him to declare himself openly.</p>

  <p>"The king of England and his nobility (remarks Commines,) were not so
  well skilled in artifice and subtlety as the lords of France, but went
  more bluntly and ingenuously about their business; so that they were not
  so sharp at discovering the intrigues and deceptions common on this side
  of the water. The English that have never travelled are naturally
  headstrong, as the people generally are in all cold countries."</p>

  <p>Commines next relates how the English, when they attempted to occupy
  the town of St. Quentin, were driven off with the loss of some killed and
  others taken prisoners; and how on the following morning the duke of
  Burgundy took his leave of king Edward, in order to return to his forces
  in Barrois, pretending he would do great feats for the English; but the
  English, being naturally of a jealous temper, novices on this side of the
  water, and astonished at this kind of proceeding, began to entertain an
  ill opinion of their ally, and were not satisfied he had any army at all;
  besides, the duke of Burgundy could not reconcile them to the constable's
  manner of receiving them, though he endeavoured to persuade them all was
  well, and that what was done would turn to their advantage; but all the
  duke of Burgundy's arguments did not pacify them, and, being disheartened
  at the approach of winter, they seemed by their expressions to be more
  inclinable to peace than war.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, king Louis was thinking upon the suggestions which had been
  made to him by Garter king of arms; and a message he received from the
  lords Howard and Stanley by a dismissed prisoner determined him to put
  them in action. With the assistance of Commines, he tutored a clever
  servant to act as a herald, equipping him for the occasion in a coat of
  arms formed from the banner of a trumpeter,&mdash;for king Louis was not
  so stately nor so vain as to maintain a herald in his train as other
  princes did.</p>

  <p>The man was sent off to the English camp, where, on his arrival, he
  was immediately conducted to the tent of king Edward. Being asked his
  business, he said he was come with a message from the king of France to
  the king of England, and had orders to address himself to the lords
  Howard and Stanley. He was taken into a tent to dinner, and very gently
  entertained. When king Edward had dined, he sent for the herald, who then
  said that his errand was to acquaint his majesty that the king of France
  had long desired to be at amity with him, that <!-- Page xxxi --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxi"></a>{xxxi}</span>both their kingdoms
  might be at ease, and enjoy the blessings of peace; that, since his
  accession to the crown of France, he had never made war or attempted
  anything against king Edward or his kingdom; and, as for having formerly
  entertained the earl of Warwick, he had done that more from opposition to
  the duke of Burgundy than from any quarrel with the king of England. He
  next proceeded to represent that the duke of Burgundy had invited king
  Edward over, only in order to make his own terms the better with France;
  and, if others had joined with him, it was to secure themselves against
  their former offences, or to advance their private objects; which when
  they had once compassed, they would not regard the interests of the king
  of England, provided they had attained their own ends. He represented
  likewise the lateness of the season, that winter was approaching, that
  his master was sensible of the great charges king Edward had been at, and
  that he knew that in England there were many, both of the nobility and
  merchants, who were desirous of a war on this side of the water; yet, if
  the king should be inclined to a treaty, his master would not refuse to
  come to such terms as should be agreeable both to himself and to his
  subjects; and if the king of England had a mind to be more particularly
  informed of these matters, on his giving a passport for 100 horse, his
  master would send ambassadors to him with full instructions: or, if king
  Edward should prefer to depute certain commissioners, king Louis would
  gladly consent to that arrangement, and send them a passport to hold a
  conference in some village between the two armies.</p>

  <p>The king of England and part of his nobility were extremely pleased
  with these proposals; a passport was given to the herald according to his
  request, and, having been rewarded with four nobles in money, he was
  attended by a herald from the king of England to obtain the king of
  France's passport in the same form as the other; which being given, the
  next morning the commissioners met in a village near Amiens. On the part
  of the king of France, there were the Bastard of Bourbon admiral of
  France, the lord of St. Pierre, and the bishop of Evreux. On the king of
  England's side, there were the lord Howard, doctor Morton then master of
  the rolls and afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, William Dudley dean of
  the king's chapel, and Thomas Selynger.<a name="NtA51"
  href="#Nt51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> Many overtures passed between these
  negociators. The English at first demanded, according to their custom,
  the crown of France; and then gradually fell to Normandy and Guienne. The
  French commissioners replied as became them; so that the demands were
  well urged on the one side, and well refused on the other: yet, from the
  very first day <!-- Page xxxii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxxii"></a>{xxxii}</span>of the treaty there was great prospect
  of an accommodation, for both parties seemed very inclinable to hearken
  to reasonable proposals.</p>

  <p>King Louis was exceedingly pleased when matters had taken this
  favourable turn, and he employed all his arts to bring the negociation to
  a peaceful termination. He sent every hour to entertain and wheedle the
  treacherous constable, and prevent him from doing any harm. He resolved
  to raise without delay the money required to buy off the invaders,<a
  name="NtA52" href="#Nt52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> declaring that he would do
  any thing in the world to get the king of England out of France, except
  putting any towns into his possession, for, rather than do that, which
  had been suggested by the constable, he would hazard all.</p>

  <p>The conclusion of the terms of the treaty was made on the 13th of
  August, king Edward being then "in his felde beside a village called
  Seyntre,<a name="NtA53" href="#Nt53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> within
  Vermondose, a litell from Peronne," attended by his brothers the dukes of
  Clarence and Gloucester, the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, the bishop of
  Lincoln his chancellor, the marquess of Dorset, the earls of
  Northumberland, Riviers, and Pembroke, the lords Grey de Ruthyn, Scrope,
  Grey of Codnor, Stanley, Hastings, Ferrers, Howard, the earl Douglas,
  lord Lisle, the master of the Rolls, the dean of the king's chapel, the
  deans of Wells and Westminster, sir Thomas Mountgomery, sir Thomas
  Borough, sir William Parre, sir Richard Tunstall, Thomas Selynger, and
  John Elkyngton treasurer of the king's wars; most of whom signed the
  public declaration<a name="NtA54" href="#Nt54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> of the
  king's determination, which is stated to have been founded on these three
  considerations,&mdash;"the povertie of his armyes, the nygh approachyng
  of wynter, and small assistance of his allies."</p>

  <p>It was at the same time agreed, that the two kings should have an
  interview, and swear mutually to the performance of certain articles;
  after which the king of England should return to his own country, upon
  the receipt of 72,000 crowns (as stated by Commines, but the amount
  finally settled was 75,000), leaving the lord Howard and sir John Cheyne
  as hostages until his arrival in England. In addition, pensions amounting
  to 16,000 crowns were promised to the privy councillors <!-- Page xxxiii
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxiii"></a>{xxxiii}</span>of the
  king of England, viz. to the lord Hastings<a name="NtA55"
  href="#Nt55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> 2000 crowns a-year, to the chancellor
  (Rotherham) 2000, and the remainder to the lord Howard, the master of the
  horse (Cheyne), Thomas St. Leger, sir Thomas Mountgomery, and several
  others, besides a great deal of ready money and plate<a name="NtA56"
  href="#Nt56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> that was distributed among the rest of
  the king of England's retinue.</p>

  <p>Louis contrived to carry his corruption through every grade of his
  adversaries. He purchased from one of the English secretaries for sixty
  silver marks two letters which had been addressed by the seigneur d'Urfé,
  who was then in the duke of Bretagne's service, (and afterwards master of
  the horse of France,) one directed to the king of England, and the other
  to the lord Hastings, lord chamberlain of England. They were shown to
  Commines, who noticed in them this, among other expressions, That the
  duke of Bretagne would do more by his intelligence in a month, than the
  king of England and the duke of Burgundy both, with all the force they
  could make.</p>

  <p>The duke of Burgundy, who was then at Luxembourg, having intimation of
  these negociations, came in great haste to the king of England, attended
  only with sixteen horse.<a name="NtA57" href="#Nt57"><sup>[57]</sup></a>
  King Edward was much surprised at his unexpected arrival, and inquired
  what it was that had brought him, for he saw by his countenance that he
  was angry. The duke told him that he came to talk with him. The king of
  England asked whether it should be in public or private? Then the duke
  demanded whether he had made a peace? The king replied, that he had made
  a truce for nine years, in which the duke of Bretagne and himself were
  <!-- Page xxxiv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxxiv"></a>{xxxiv}</span>comprehended,<a name="NtA58"
  href="#Nt58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> and his desire was that they should
  accept of that comprehension. The duke fell into a violent passion, and
  in English, a language that he spoke very well, began to recount the
  glorious achievements of Edward's predecessors on the throne of England,
  who had formerly invaded France, and how they had spared no pains, nor
  refused any danger, that might render them famous, and gain them immortal
  honour and renown abroad. Then he inveighed against the truce, and told
  the king he had not invited the English over into France out of any
  necessity he had of their assistance, but only to put them in a way of
  recovering their own right and inheritance; and, to convince them he
  could subsist without their alliance, he was resolved not to make use of
  the truce until the king had been three months in England. Having
  unburthened himself in this manner, the duke took his leave, and returned
  to Luxembourg. The king of England and his council were extremely
  irritated by his language, but others who were adverse to the peace
  highly extolled it.</p>

  <p>But, however dissatisfied the duke was with the truce, the constable
  of France had cause to be still more so: for, having deceived all
  parties, he could expect nothing but inevitable ruin. He made one more
  attempt to ingratiate himself with king Edward, by offering him the towns
  of Eu and St. Valery for winter quarters, and a loan of 50,000 crowns;
  but king Louis immediately received intimation of this, and at once
  ordered the two towns to be burned. King Edward returned to the constable
  this answer, "That the truce was already concluded, and could not be
  altered; but, had the constable performed his former promise (as to the
  town of St. Quentin), the truce would never have been made." This answer
  stung the constable to the very soul, and made him desperate on all
  sides.</p>

  <p>In order to bring the treaty to a conclusion, king Edward advanced
  within half a league of Amiens; and the king of France, being upon one of
  the gates of the city, (where he had arrived on the 22d of August,)
  viewed from a distance the English army marching up. "Speaking
  impartially, (continues Commines,) the troops seemed but raw and unused
  to action in the field; for they were in very ill order, and observed no
  manner of discipline. Our king sent the king of England 300 cartloads<a
  name="NtA59" href="#Nt59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> of the best wines in France
  as a present, and I think the <!-- Page xxxv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxxv"></a>{xxxv}</span>carts made as great a show as the whole
  English army. Upon the strength of the truce, numbers of the English came
  into the town, where they behaved themselves very imprudently, and
  without the least regard to their prince's honour; for they entered the
  streets all armed, and in great companies, so that if the king of France
  could have dispensed with his oath, never was there so favourable an
  opportunity of cutting off a considerable number of them; but his
  majesty's design was only to entertain them nobly, and to settle a firm
  and lasting peace, that might endure during his reign. The king had
  ordered two long tables to be placed on either side the street, at the
  entrance of the town gate, which were covered with a variety of good
  dishes of all sorts of viands most likely to relish their wine, of which
  there was great plenty, and of the richest that France could produce,
  with a troop of servants to wait on them; but not a drop of water was
  drank. At each of the tables the king had placed five or six boon
  companions, persons of rank and condition, to entertain those who had a
  mind to take a hearty glass, amongst whom were the lord of Craon, the
  lord of Briquebec, the lord of Bressure, the lord of Villiers, and
  several others. As the English came up to the gate, they saw what was
  prepared, and there were persons appointed on purpose to take their
  horses by the bridles and lead them to the tables, where every man was
  treated handsomely, as he came in his turn, to their very great
  satisfaction. When they had once entered the town, wherever they went, or
  whatever they called for, nothing was to be paid; there were nine or ten
  taverns liberally furnished with all that they wanted, the French king
  bearing all the costs of that entertainment, which lasted three or four
  days."</p>

  <p>On Childermas day (the 28th of August<a name="NtA60"
  href="#Nt60"><sup>[60]</sup></a>) the license of the English visitors had
  grown to such a height, that it was. estimated that there were at least
  9000 of them in the town. The councillors of Louis were alarmed, and
  although on that day the superstitious monarch never spoke upon business,
  nor allowed any one else to address him thereon, but took it as an ill
  omen, Commines was induced to disturb his devotions, in order to inform
  him of the state of affairs. The king commanded him immediately to get on
  horseback, and endeavour to speak with some of the English captains of
  note, to persuade them to order their troops to retire, and if he met any
  of the French captains to send them to him, for he <!-- Page xxxvi
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxvi"></a>{xxxvi}</span>would be
  at the gate as soon as Commines. Commines met three or four English
  commanders of his acquaintance, and spoke to them according to the king's
  directions; but for one man that they directed to leave the town, there
  were twenty that came in. In company with the lord of Gié (afterwards
  maréchal of France) Commines went into a tavern, where, though it was not
  yet one o'clock, there had already been a hundred and eleven reckonings
  that morning. The house was filled with company; some were singing,
  others were asleep, and all were drunk; upon observing which
  circumstance, Commines concluded there was no danger, and sent to inform
  the king of it; who came immediately to the gate, well attended, having
  commanded 200 or 300 men at arms to be harnessed privately in their
  captains' houses, some of whom he posted at the gate by which the English
  entered. The king then ordered his dinner to be brought to the porter's
  lodgings at the gate, where he dined, and did several English captains
  the honour of admitting them to dinner with him. The king of England had
  been informed of this disorder, and was much ashamed of it, and sent to
  the king of France to desire him to admit no more of his soldiers into
  the town. The king of France sent him word back he would not do that, but
  if the king of England pleased to send a party of his own guards thither,
  the gate should <span class="correction" title="Original reads `he'."
  >be</span> delivered up to their charge, and they then might let in or
  shut out whomever they pleased, which was done accordingly.</p>

  <p>In order to bring the whole affair to a conclusion, consultation was
  now taken for the place that might be most convenient for the proposed
  interview between the two kings, and commissioners were appointed to
  survey it,&mdash;the lord du Bouchage and Commines on the French part,
  and the lord Howard, Thomas St. Leger, and a herald on the English. Upon
  taking view of the river, they agreed upon Picquigny, where the Somme is
  neither wide nor fordable. On the one side, by which king Louis would
  approach, was a fine open country; and on the other side it was the same,
  only when king Edward came to the river, he was obliged to traverse a
  causeway about two bow-shots in length, with marshes on both sides,
  "which might (remarks Commines) have produced very dangerous consequences
  to the English, if our intentions had not been honourable. And certainly,
  as I have said before, the English do not manage their treaties and
  capitulations with so much cunning and policy as the French do, let
  people say what they will, but proceed more openly, and with greater
  straightforwardness; yet a man must be careful, and take heed not to
  affront them, for it is dangerous meddling with them."</p>

  <p>When the place of meeting was settled, the next business was to build
  a bridge, <!-- Page xxxvii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexxxvii"></a>{xxxvii}</span>which was done by French carpenters.
  The bridge was large and strong, and in the midst was contrived a massive
  wooden lattice, such as lions' cages were made with, every aperture
  between the bars being no wider than to admit a man's arm; at the top
  were merely boards to keep off the rain, and the area was large enough to
  contain ten or twelve men on a side, the bars running full out to either
  side of the bridge, to hinder any person from passing either to the one
  side or the other. For passage across the river there was provided only
  one small boat, rowed by two men.</p>

  <p>The incident in French history which suggested these extraordinary
  precautions had occurred fifty-six years before; when, at a similar
  meeting upon a bridge at Montereau fault Yonne, John duke of Burgundy and
  his attendants were treacherously slaughtered in the presence of Charles
  the Seventh (then Dauphin), in revenge for the murder of Louis duke of
  Orleans. In the barricade of that fatal bridge there was a wicket, which
  the duke himself incautiously opened; a circumstance which the timid
  Louis well remembered, and he now repeated the story to Commines, and
  expressly commanded that there should be no such doorway.</p>

  <p>When the bridge at Picquigny was ready, the interview between the two
  kings took place on the 29th of August 1475. The description which
  Commines gives of it is highly graphic and interesting: "The king of
  France came first, attended by about 800 men of arms. On the king of
  England's side, his whole army was drawn up in battle array; and, though
  we could not ascertain their total force, yet we saw such a vast number
  both of horse and foot, that the body of troops which was with us seemed
  very inconsiderable in comparison with them; but indeed the fourth part
  of our army was not there. It was arranged that twelve men of a side were
  to attend each of the kings at the interview, and they were already
  chosen from among their greatest and most trusty courtiers. We had with
  us four of the king of England's retinue to view what was done among us,
  and they had as many of ours, on their side, to have an eye over their
  actions. As I said before, our king came first to the barriers, attended
  by twelve persons, among whom were John duke of Bourbon and the cardinal

  <p>"The king of England advanced along the causeway very nobly attended,
  with the air and presence of a king." Commines recognised in his train
  his brother the duke of Clarence, the earl of Northumberland, his
  chamberlain the lord Hastings, his chancellor, and other peers of the
  realm; "among whom there were not above three or four dressed in cloth of
  gold like himself. The king wore a black velvet cap upon his head, and on
  it a large fleur-de-lis made of precious stones&mdash;[probably as a
  compliment to the French king]. He was a prince of a noble and majestic
  presence, but a little inclining to corpulence. I had seen him before
  when the earl of Warwick drove him out of his kingdom, in 1470<a
  name="NtA63" href="#Nt63"><sup>[63]</sup></a>; then I thought him much
  handsomer, and, to the best of my remembrance, my eyes had never beheld a
  more handsome person. When he came within a little distance of the
  barrier he pulled off his cap, and bowed himself within half a foot of
  the ground; and the king of France, who was then leaning against the
  barrier, received him with abundance of reverence and respect. They
  embraced through the apertures of the barriers, and, the king of England
  making him another low bow, the king of France saluted him thus, 'Cousin,
  you are heartily welcome! There is no person living I was so desirous of
  seeing; and God be thanked that this interview is upon so good an
  occasion.' King Edward returned the compliment in very good French<a
  name="NtA64" href="#Nt64"><sup>[64]</sup></a>."</p>

<p><!-- Page xxxix --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxix"></a>{xxxix}</span></p>

  <p>"Then the chancellor of England (who was a prelate, and bishop of
  Lincoln) began his speech with a prophecy (with which the English are
  always provided), that at Picquigny a memorable peace was to be concluded
  between the English and French. After he had finished his harangue, the
  instrument was produced containing the articles which the king of France
  had sent to the king of England. The chancellor demanded of the king,
  whether he had dictated the said articles? and whether he agreed to them?
  The king replied, Yes; and when king Edward's letters were produced on
  our side, he made the like answer. The missal being then brought and
  opened, both the kings laid one of their hands upon the book, and the
  other upon the holy true cross, and both of them swore religiously to
  observe the contents of the truce.</p>

  <p>"This solemnity performed, king Louis (who had always words at
  command) told king Edward in a jocular way that he should be glad to see
  him at Paris, and that if he would come and divert himself with the
  ladies, he would assign the cardinal of Bourbon for his confessor, who he
  knew would willingly absolve him if he should commit any peccadillo in
  the way of love and gallantry. King Edward was extremely pleased with his
  raillery, and made him many good repartees, for he was aware that the
  cardinal was a gay man with the ladies, and a boon companion.</p>

  <p>"After some further discourse to this purpose, the French king, to
  shew his authority, commanded those who attended him to withdraw, for he
  had a mind to have a little private discourse with the king of England.
  They obeyed; and those who were with king Edward, seeing the French
  retire, did the same, without waiting to be commanded. After the two
  kings had conversed together alone for some time, our master (continues
  Commines) called me to him, and asked the king <!-- Page xl --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexl"></a>{xl}</span>of England whether he
  knew me. King Edward said that he did, naming the places where he had
  seen me, and told the king that I had formerly endeavoured to serve him
  at Calais, when I was in the duke of Burgundy's service. The king of
  France demanded, If the duke of Burgundy refused to be comprehended in
  the treaty&mdash;as might be suspected from his obstinate
  answer&mdash;what the king of England would have him do? The king of
  England replied, he would offer it to him a second time, and, if he then
  refused it, he would not concern himself any further, but leave it
  entirely to themselves. By degrees king Louis came to mention the duke of
  Bretagne, who was really the person he aimed at in the question, and made
  the same demand as to him. The king of England desired that he would not
  attempt anything against the duke of Bretagne, for in his distress he had
  never found so true and faithful a friend. Louis then pressed him no
  further, but, recalling the company, took his leave of king Edward<a
  name="NtA65" href="#Nt65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> in the politest and most
  flattering terms imaginable, and saluted all his attendants with especial
  courtesy; whereupon both monarchs at the same time retired from the
  barrier, and, mounting on horseback, the king of France returned to
  Amiens, and the king of England to his army. King Edward was supplied
  from the French household with whatever he required, to the very torches
  and candles."</p>

  <p>By the treaty thus concluded king Edward engaged to return to England
  with his army so soon as king Louis had paid him the sum of 75,000
  crowns. A truce for seven years was concluded between the two sovereigns;
  and they mutually undertook to assist each other in case either prince
  should be attacked by his enemies or by his rebellious subjects; and, to
  make this alliance still closer, Charles the son of Louis was to wed the
  princess Elizabeth, king Edward's eldest daughter, so soon as they were
  both of marriageable age.</p>

  <p>By the fourth and last article, the king of France engaged to pay
  annually to the king of England, in two instalments, the sum of 50,000
  crowns.</p>

  <p>Commines states that the duke of Gloucester, king Edward's younger
  brother, and some other Englishmen of high rank, being averse to the
  treaty, were not present at the interview; though (he adds) they
  afterwards recollected themselves, and the duke of Gloucester waited upon
  king Louis at Amiens, where he was splendidly entertained, and received
  noble presents both of plate and of fine horses.</p>

<p><!-- Page xli --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexli"></a>{xli}</span></p>

  <p>The chronicler Jean de Molinet also mentions the duke of Gloucester's
  disapproval of the peace, although, as we have seen, he had signed the
  preliminary articles of agreement on the 13th of August. It is by no
  means inconsistent with the aspiring character of Richard duke of
  Gloucester&mdash;who at this period was not twenty-three years of
  age&mdash;that he should have affected to place himself at the head of
  the more martial and chivalrous party of the English nobility, and that
  Commines had good information of his policy in that respect.</p>

  <p>The same delightful historian, who, not content with barren facts,
  confidentially introduces his readers into the secret motives and
  reflections of the actors in his story, supplies some remarkable
  particulars of the sentiments of his master king Louis on the result of
  this memorable interview, which form as it were the finishing touches of
  his picture.</p>

  <p>Whilst Louis was riding back to Amiens, he expressed his misgivings
  upon two incidents in what had passed. One was that the king of England
  had so readily caught at the idea of visiting Paris. "He is (said Louis,)
  a handsome prince, a great admirer of the ladies, and who knows but that
  he might find one of them at Paris, who would say so many pretty things
  to him, as to make him desirous to come again? His ancestors have been
  too often in Paris and Normandy already; and I do not care for his
  company so near, though on the other side of the water I shall be ready
  to esteem him as my friend and brother." Louis was also displeased to
  find the English king so resolute in relation to the duke of Bretagne,
  upon whom he would fain have made war; and to that purpose he made him
  further overtures by the lord de Bouchage and the lord de St. Pierre; but
  when Edward found himself pressed, he gave them this short but honourable
  answer, that if any one invaded the duke of Bretagne's dominions he would
  cross the sea again in his defence. Upon which the French king importuned
  him no more.</p>

  <p>When Louis was arrived at Amiens, and was ready to go to supper, three
  or four of the English lords, who had attended upon the king of England
  at the interview, came to sup with his majesty; and one of them, the lord
  Howard, told the king in his ear that, if he desired it, he would readily
  find a way to bring the king his master to him to Amiens, and perhaps to
  Paris too, to be merry with him. Though this proposition was not in the
  least agreeable to Louis, yet he dissembled the matter pretty well, and
  began washing his hands, without giving a direct answer; but he whispered
  to Commines, and said that what he had dreaded was really coming to pass.
  After supper the subject was renewed, but the king then put it off with
  the greatest quietness and tact <!-- Page xlii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexlii"></a>{xlii}</span>imaginable, alleging
  that his expedition against the duke of Burgundy would require his
  departure immediately.</p>

  <p>Thus, (as our pleasant friend remarks,) though these affairs were of
  the highest moment, and required the gravest caution to manage them
  discreetly, yet they were not unattended by some agreeable incidents that
  deserve to be related to posterity. Nor ought any man to wonder,
  considering the great mischiefs which the English had brought upon the
  kingdom of France, and the freshness of their date, that the king should
  incur so much trouble and expense to send them home in an amicable
  manner, and endeavour to make them his friends for the future, or at
  least divert them from being his enemies.</p>

  <p>The next day the English came into Amiens in great numbers, and some
  of them reported that the Holy Ghost had made the peace, producing some
  prophecy in support of the assertion: but their greatest proof was that
  during the interview a white dove came and sat upon the king of England's
  tent, and could not be frightened away by any noise they could make. The
  less superstitious, however, explained the incident more rationally; a
  shower having fallen, and the sun afterwards shining out very warm, when
  the pigeon, finding that tent higher than the others, came thither to dry
  herself. This was the explanation given to Commines by a Gascon gentleman
  named Louis de Bretailles,<a name="NtA66"
  href="#Nt66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> who was in the king of England's
  service. This gentleman was one of those who saw further than others into
  the state of affairs, and, being an old acquaintance of Commines, he
  privately <!-- Page xliii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexliii"></a>{xliii}</span>expressed his opinion that the French
  were making sport of the king of England. During the conversation,
  Commines asked him how many battles king Edward had fought. He answered
  nine, and that he had been in every one of them in person. Commines then
  asked how many he had lost. Bretailles replied, Never but one; and that
  was this, in which the French had outwitted him now; for in his opinion
  the ignominy of king Edward's returning so soon after such vast
  preparations, would be a greater disgrace and stain to his reputation
  than all the honour he had achieved in his nine previous victories.
  Commines repeated this smart answer to his master, who replied, He is a
  shrewd fellow, I warrant him, and we must have a care of his tongue. The
  next day Louis sent for him, had him to dinner at his own table, and made
  him very advantageous proposals, if he would quit his master's service,
  and live in France; but, finding he was not to be prevailed upon, he
  presented him with a thousand crowns, and promised he would do great
  matters for his brothers in France. Upon his going away, Commines
  whispered him in his ear, and desired him to employ his good offices to
  continue and propagate that love and good understanding which was so
  happily begun between the two kings.</p>

  <p>Though Louis could scarcely conceal his delight and self-gratulation
  at the success of his policy, yet his timidity was continually revived
  when he imagined that he had dropped any expressions that might reach the
  ears of the English, and make them suspect that he had overreached and
  deluded them. On the morning following the interview, being alone in his
  closet with only three or four of his attendants, he began to droll and
  jest upon the wines and presents which he had sent into the English camp,
  but, turning suddenly round, he became aware of the presence of a Gascon
  merchant who lived in England, and was come to solicit license to export
  a certain quantity of Bordeaux wines without paying the duties. Louis was
  startled at seeing him, and wondered how he had gained admission. The
  king asked him of what town in Guienne he was, whether he was a merchant,
  and whether married in England. The man replied yes, he had a wife in
  England, but what estate he had there was but small. Before he went away,
  the king appointed one to go with him to Bordeaux, and Commines had also
  some talk with him, by his majesty's express command. Louis conferred on
  him a considerable post of employment in his native town, granted him
  exemption from duty <!-- Page xliv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexliv"></a>{xliv}</span>for his wines, and gave him a thousand
  francs to bring his wife over from England, but he was to send his
  brother for her, and not go personally to fetch her; and all these
  penalties the king imposed upon himself for having indulged in too great
  freedom of speech.</p>

  <p>As soon as king Edward had received his money, and delivered the lord
  Howard and sir John Cheyne as hostages until he was landed in England, he
  retired towards Calais by long and hasty marches, for he was suspicious
  of the duke of Burgundy's anger, and the vengeance of the peasants; and,
  indeed, if any of his soldiers straggled, some of them were sure to be
  knocked on the head.</p>

  <p>"Uppon the xxviijth daye of Septembre folowynge he was with great
  tryumphe receyved of the mayor and cytezeyns of London at Blakheth, and
  with all honoure by theym conveyed thorugh the cytie unto Westmynster,
  the mayer and aldermen beynge clade in scarlet, and the commoners to the
  nombre of v C. in murrey."<a name="NtA67"
  href="#Nt67"><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The treacherous constable of France again turning round, in order if
  possible to recover his lost favour with his own sovereign,<a
  name="NtA68" href="#Nt68"><sup>[68]</sup></a> sent a messenger to Louis,
  offering to persuade the duke of Burgundy to join his forces with the
  king's, and destroy the king of England and his whole army on their
  return. But this last shift of the baffled traitor only contributed to
  confirm his ruin. King Edward communicated to Louis (probably before this
  offer) two letters which the constable had addressed to him, and related
  all the proposals he had from time to time made; so that his three-fold
  treasons were revealed to all the princes with whose rival interests he
  had endeavoured to play his own game, and they were all alike provoked to
  join in his destruction.</p>

  <p>Louis contemplated his punishment with the bitterest animosity. When
  he received the overture above stated, there were only in his presence
  the lord <!-- Page xlv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexlv"></a>{xlv}</span>Howard the English hostage, the lord de
  Coutay, who was newly returned from an embassy to the duke of Burgundy,
  the lord du Lude, and Commines, which two had been employed to receive
  the constable's messenger. The king, calling for one of his secretaries,
  dictated a letter to the constable, acquainting him with what had been
  transacted the day before in relation to the truce; and adding that at
  that instant he had weighty affairs upon his hands, and wanted such a
  head as his to finish them. Then turning to the English nobleman and to
  the lord de Coutay, he said, "I do not mean his body. I would have his
  head with me, and his body where it is." After the letter had been read,
  Louis delivered it to Rapine the constable's messenger, who was mightily
  pleased with it, and took it as a great compliment in the king to write
  that he wanted such a head as his master's, for he did not perceive the
  ambiguity and sting of the expression.</p>

  <p>We are now arrived at the closing reflections of Commines upon the
  course which events had taken in France at this memorable crisis. "At the
  beginning of our affairs with the English, you may remember that the king
  of England had no great inclination to make his descent; and as soon as
  he came to Dover, and before his embarkation there, he entered into a
  sort of treaty with us. But that which prevailed with him to transport
  his army to Calais was first the solicitation of the duke of Burgundy,
  and the natural animosity of the English against the French, which has
  existed in all ages; and next to reserve to himself a great part of the
  money which had been liberally granted him for that expedition; for, as
  you have already heard, the kings of England live upon their own demesne
  revenue, and can raise no taxes but under the pretence of invading
  France. Besides, the king had another stratagem by which to content his
  subjects; for he had brought with him ten or twelve citizens of London,
  and other towns in England, all fat and jolly, the leaders of the English
  commons, of great power in their countries, such as had promoted the wars
  and had been very serviceable in raising that powerful army. The king
  ordered very fine tents to be made for them, in which they lay; but, that
  not being the kind of living they had been used to, they soon began to
  grow weary of the campaign, for they expected they should come to an
  engagement within three days of their landing, and the king multiplied
  their fears and exaggerated the dangers of the war, on purpose that they
  might be better satisfied with a peace, and aid him to quiet the murmurs
  of the people upon his return to England; for, since king Arthur's days,
  never king of England invaded France with so great a number of the
  nobility and such a formidable army. But, as you have heard, he returned
  immediately into England upon the conclusion of the peace, and then
  reserved for his own private use the <!-- Page xlvi --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexlvi"></a>{xlvi}</span>greater part of the
  money that had been raised to pay the army; so that, in reality, he
  accomplished most of the designs he had in view. King Edward was not of a
  complexion or turn of mind to endure much hardship and labour, and such
  any king of England must encounter who designs to make any considerable
  conquest in France. Besides, our king was in a tolerable posture of
  defence, though he was not so well prepared in all respects as he ought
  to have been, by reason of the variety and multitude of his enemies.
  Another great object with the king of England was the arrangement of a
  marriage between our present king Charles the Eighth and his daughter;
  and this alliance, causing him to wink at several things, was a material
  advantage to our master's affairs.</p>

  <p>"King Louis himself was very desirous to obtain a general peace. The
  vast numbers of the English had put him into great alarm; he had seen
  enough of their exploits in his time in his kingdom, and he had no wish
  to witness any more of them."</p>

  <p>When Louis went to meet the duke of Burgundy's plenipotentiaries at a
  bridge half-way between Avesnes and Vervins, he took the English hostages
  with him, and they were present when he gave audience to the Burgundians.
  "One of them then told Commines that, if they had seen many such men of
  the duke of Burgundy's before, perhaps the peace had not been concluded
  so soon. The vîcomte of Narbonne, (afterwards comte of Foix,) overhearing
  him, replied, 'Could you be so weak as to believe that the duke of
  Burgundy had not great numbers of such soldiers? he had only sent them
  into quarters of refreshment; but you were in such haste to be at home
  again, that six hundred pipes of wine and a pension from our king sent
  you presently back into England.' The Englishman was irritated, and
  answered with much warmth, 'I plainly see, as everybody said, that you
  have done nothing but cheat us. But do you call the money your king has
  given us a pension? It is a tribute; and, by Saint George! you may prate
  so much as will bring us back again to prove it.' I interrupted their
  altercation, and turned it into a jest; but the Englishman would not
  understand it so, and I informed the king of it, and his majesty was much
  offended with the vîcomte of Narbonne."</p>

  <p>King Edward, being highly disgusted with the duke of Burgundy's
  rejection of his truce, and his subsequent offer to make a distinct peace
  with the king of France, despatched a great favourite of his, named sir
  Thomas Mountgomery, to king Louis at Vervins, and he arrived whilst the
  negociation was proceeding with the duke of Burgundy's envoys. Sir Thomas
  desired, on the behalf of the king his master, that the king of France
  would not consent to any other truce with the <!-- Page xlvii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagexlvii"></a>{xlvii}</span>duke than what was
  already made.<a name="NtA69" href="#Nt69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> He also
  pressed Louis not to deliver St. Quentin into the duke's hands; and, as
  further encouragement, Edward offered to repass the seas in the following
  spring with a powerful army to assist him, provided his majesty would
  continue in war against the duke of Burgundy, and compensate him for the
  prejudice he should sustain in his duties upon wool at Calais, which
  would be worth little or nothing in war time, though at other times they
  were valued at 50,000 crowns. He proposed likewise that the king of
  France should pay one-half of his army, and he would pay the other
  himself. Louis returned Edward abundance of thanks, and made sir Thomas a
  present of plate: but as to the continuation of the war, he begged to be
  excused, for the truce with Burgundy was already concluded, and upon the
  same terms as those which had been already agreed to between them; only
  the duke of Burgundy had pressed urgently to have a separate truce for
  himself; which circumstance Louis excused as well as he could, in order
  to satisfy the English ambassador, who with this answer returned home,
  accompanied by the hostages. "The king (adds Commines) felt extremely
  surprised at king Edward's offers, which were delivered before me only,
  and he conceived it would be very dangerous to bring the king of England
  into France again, for between those two nations, when brought into
  contact, any trifling accident might raise some new quarrel, and the
  English might easily make friends again with the duke of Burgundy." These
  considerations greatly forwarded the conclusion of the king of France's
  treaty with the Burgundians.</p>

  <p>In fact, the duke of Burgundy at last overreached his brother-in-law
  king Edward, for he concluded a truce with France for nine years, whilst
  that of England with France was for seven years only. The duke's
  ambassadors requested king Louis that this truce might not be proclaimed
  immediately by sound of trumpet, as the usual custom was, for they were
  anxious to save the duke's oath to king Edward (when he swore in his
  passion that he would not accept of the benefit of the truce until the
  king had been in England three months), lest Edward should think their
  master had spoken otherwise than he designed.</p>

  <p>As for Edward himself, whatever selfish satisfaction he may have
  derived from the result of the campaign,&mdash;such as Commines has
  already suggested&mdash;it must have weakened his popularity both with
  his nobles and with his people, whilst it terminated the former
  cordiality that had existed with his brother of Burgundy. The king of
  England had now become the pensioner of France, the great <!-- Page
  xlviii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexlviii"></a>{xlviii}</span>absorbing power of that age, which
  was soon to swallow up England's nearest and best allies, the duchies of
  Burgundy and Britany.</p>

  <p>The French pension of 50,000 crowns was, as Commines relates,
  punctually paid every half-year in the Tower of London; and by a treaty
  made in Feb. 1478-9 it was renewed for the lives of Edward and Louis, and
  extended for a hundred years after the death of both princes: which
  seemed to give it more directly the character of a tribute, a term that
  Commines says the English applied to it, but which the French indignantly
  repelled. However, after little more than four years longer, it had
  answered its purpose, and its payment ceased. The English voluptuary then
  found himself entirely outwitted by the wily Frenchman. After the duke of
  Burgundy's death (in 1477) and that of his only daughter the wife of the
  archduke Maximilian (in 1482) his grand-daughter Margaret of Austria was
  suddenly betrothed to the Dauphin, in the place of the lady Elizabeth of
  England. Louis caught at this alliance in order to detach the counties of
  Burgundy and Artois from the territory of the Netherlands, and annex them
  to the crown of France; and the turbulent citizens of Ghent, in whose
  keeping the children<a name="NtA70" href="#Nt70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> of
  their late sovereign lady were, were ready to make this concession,
  without the concurrence of the children's father, in order to reduce the
  power of their princes. This infant bride was then only three years and a
  half old; and had consequently made her appearance on the stage of life
  subsequently to the Dauphin's former contract with the English
  princess.<a name="NtA71" href="#Nt71"><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Commines describes at some length the mortification experienced by
  king Edward when he heard of this alliance,&mdash;"finding himself
  deluded in the hopes he had entertained of marrying his daughter to the
  Dauphin, of which marriage both himself and his queen were more ambitious
  than of any other in the world, and never would give credit to any man,
  whether subject or foreigner, that endeavoured to persuade them that our
  king's intentions were not sincere and honourable. For the parliament (or
  council) of England had remonstrated to king Edward several times, when
  our king was in Picardy, that after he had conquered <!-- Page xlix
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexlix"></a>{xlix}</span>that
  province he would certainly fall upon Calais and Guines, which are not
  far off. The ambassadors from the duke and duchess of Austria, as also
  those from the duke of Bretagne, who were continually in England at that
  time, represented the same thing to him; but to no purpose, for he would
  believe nothing of it, and he suffered greatly for his incredulity. Yet I
  am entirely of opinion that his conduct proceeded not so much from
  ignorance as avarice; for he was afraid to lose his pension of fifty
  thousand crowns, which our master paid him very punctually, and besides
  he was unwilling to leave his ease and pleasures, to which he was
  extremely devoted."</p>

  <p>The enervated temper of Edward's latter years is faithfully depicted
  in the opening lines of one of the best-known works of our great Dramatic
  Poet:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths,</p>
      <p>Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;</p>
      <p>Our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings,</p>
      <p>Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.</p>
      <p>Grim-visaged War hath smooth'd his wrinkled front,</p>
      <p>And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds,</p>
      <p>To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,</p>
      <p>He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber,</p>
      <p>To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.</p>
      <p class="i20"><i>Shakspeare's Richard the Third, act i. sc. 1.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In another place Commines attributes the death of Edward the Fourth to
  the vexation he conceived at the great reverse in his political
  prospects, which disclosed itself on his loss of the French alliance.
  This conclusion is probably imaginary, though Edward's death certainly
  occurred whilst the Dauphin's new betrothal was in progress. The treaty
  of Arras, by which the arrangement was made, was signed on the 23d Dec.
  1482, and the lady Margaret was delivered to the French, and met the
  Dauphin at Amboise, on the 22d of June following. King Edward died on the
  intervening 9th of April, a victim, as is generally thought, to his long
  course of intemperate living. It is obvious, however, that the failure of
  the French alliance must have been a very serious loss to Edward's
  family, who were left defenceless on his death, although he had
  previously contracted his daughters to the heirs of France, Scotland,
  Spain, and Burgundy.</p>

  <p>Altogether, the ruin of the house of York, if we may credit Commines,
  was the eventual result of the fatal compromise made in the campaign of
  1475, and of <!-- Page l --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagel"></a>{l}</span>the enervating and corrupting influences
  exercised by the French pensions which were then accepted by king Edward
  and his ministers. Thenceforward, any hope of recovering the English
  provinces of France was indefinitely deferred; the very echoes of those
  martial glories which had once made the English name so dreadful in that
  country were allowed to die away; the dreams of conquest were dissipated;
  and the hands of Englishmen again turned to internecine contests, which
  resulted in the total destruction of the royal house of Plantagenet, and
  the ruin of a large proportion of the ancient nobility.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">The Boke of Noblesse</span>, after the total failure
  of those more generous sentiments and aspirations which it was intended
  to propagate, at once became, what it is now, a mere mirror of by-gone
  days; and, considering these circumstances, we cannot be surprised that
  it was never again transcribed, nor found its way to the press.</p>

  <p>It is with regret that I relinquish to some future more fortunate
  inquirer the discovery of the author of this composition. The manuscript
  from which it is printed is certainly not his autograph original; for its
  great inaccuracy occasionally renders the meaning almost unintelligible.
  And yet the corrections and insertions, which I have indicated as coming
  <i>à secundâ manu</i>, would seem to belong to the author.</p>

  <p>I have already, in the first page of this Introduction, intimated the
  possibility of the work having been composed in the lifetime of sir John
  Fastolfe, and merely re-edited, if we may use the term, upon occasion of
  the projected invasion of France in 1475. There are three circumstances
  which decidedly connect the book with some dependent of sir John
  Fastolfe:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. That the writer quotes sir John as "mine autour," or informant, in
  pp. <a href="#page16">16</a> and <a href="#page64">64</a>, as well as
  tells other anecdotes which were probably received from his relation.</p>

  <p>2. His having access to sir John's papers or books of account (p. <a
  href="#page68">68</a>); and</p>

  <p>3. There being still preserved in the volume, bound up with its
  fly-leaves, the two letters, probably both addressed to Fastolfe, and one
  of them certainly so, which are printed hereafter, as an Appendix to
  these remarks.</p>

  <p>Sir John Fastolfe is not commemorated as having been a patron of
  literature. In the inventory of his property which is printed in the
  twentieth volume of the Archæologia, no books occur except a few missals,
  &amp;c. belonging to his chapel. Though William of Worcestre, now famous
  for his historical collections, (which have been edited by Hearne,
  Nasmith, and Dallaway,) was Fastolfe's secretary, he was kept in a
  subordinate position, and valued for his merely clerical, <!-- Page li
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pageli"></a>{li}</span>not his
  literary, services. Sir John Fastolfe's passion was the acquisition of
  property; whilst William of Worcestre, on his part, followed (as far as
  he could) the bent of his own taste, and not that of his master; being
  (as his comrade Henry Windsore declared) as glad to obtain a good book of
  French or of Poetry as his master Fastolfe was to purchase a fair
  manor.<a name="NtA72" href="#Nt72"><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The translation of Cicero de Senectute, which was printed by Caxton in
  1481, is indeed in the preface stated to have been translated by the
  ordinance and desire of the noble ancient knight sir John Fastolfe;<a
  name="NtA73" href="#Nt73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> and, though Worcestre's
  name is not mentioned by Caxton, we may conclude that it was the same
  translation which from Worcestre's own memoranda we know was made by
  him.<a name="NtA74" href="#Nt74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> Still, it was but a
  very slight deference to literature, if the ancient knight approved of
  his secretary's translating "Tully on Old Age," and did not make any
  further contribution towards its publication.</p>

  <p>But on the particular subject of the loss of the English provinces in
  France, and the causes thereof, there can be no question that sir John
  Fastolfe, the "baron <!-- Page lii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagelii"></a>{lii}</span>of Sillie le Guillem," once governor of
  Anjou and Maine, and lord of Piron and Beaumont, took the deepest
  interest; considering that he had spent his best days in their
  acquisition, administration, and defence, and that he was one of the
  principal sufferers by their loss. He may, therefore, well have promoted
  the composition of the work now before us.</p>

  <p>William of Worcestre has the reputation of having written a memoir<a
  name="NtA75" href="#Nt75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> of the exploits of sir John
  Fastolfe; but this is not traceable beyond the bare assertion of Bale,
  and a more recent misapprehension of the meaning of one of the Paston
  letters.</p>

<p><!-- Page liii --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pageliii"></a>{liii}</span></p>

  <p>Another person whose name has occurred as having been employed in a
  literary capacity for sir John Fastolfe<a name="NtA76"
  href="#Nt76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> is Peter Basset<a name="NtA77"
  href="#Nt77"><sup>[77]</sup></a>; who is commemorated with some parade by
  Bale as an historical writer, but whose writings, though quoted by Hall
  the chronicler, have either disappeared or are no longer to be
  identified.</p>

  <p>I have, however, mentioned the names of William of Worcestre and Peter
  Basset only from the circumstance of their being connected with that of
  sir John <!-- Page liv --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageliv"></a>{liv}</span>Fastolfe; and not from there being any
  other presumptive proof that either of them wrote "The Boke of Noblesse."
  We have no known production of Basset with which to compare it; and as to
  Worcestre his "Collectanea" and private Memoranda can scarcely assist us
  in determining what his style might have been had he attempted any such
  work as the present.</p>

  <p>Altogether, The Boke of Noblesse is more of a compilation than an
  original essay. It has apparently largely borrowed from the French; and I
  have already shown that it was partly derived from former works, though I
  cannot undertake to say to what extent that was the case. In its general
  character our book resembles one which was popular in the middle ages, as
  the <i>Secretum Secretorum</i>, falsely attributed to Aristotle,<a
  name="NtA78" href="#Nt78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> and which was also known
  under the title <i>De Regimine Principum</i>. The popularity of this work
  was so great that MS. copies occur in most of our public libraries, and
  not less than nine English translations and six French translations are
  known.<a name="NtA79" href="#Nt79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> A Scots
  translation by sir Gilbert de Hay, entitled "<i>The Buke of the
  Governaunce of Princis</i>," is contained in a MS. at Abbotsford,
  accompanying a version of <i>The Tree of Batailes</i>, already noticed in
  pp. <a href="#pageiii">iii</a>. <a href="#pagevi">vi</a>.</p>

  <p>Another work of the same class is that of which Caxton published
  (about the year 1484) a translation entitled <i>The booke of the ordre of
  Chevalrye or Knyghthode</i>, and of which the Scots translation by sir
  Gilbert de Hay was printed for the Abbotsford Club by Beriah Botfield,
  esq. in 1847.</p>

  <p>To his translations of the treatises of Cicero on Old Age and
  Friendship, which Caxton printed in 1481, he also appended two
  "declaracyons," or orations, supposed to be spoken by two noble Roman
  knights before the senate, in order "to know wherein Noblesse restith,"
  or, as otherwise expressed in the title-page, "shewing wherin Honoure
  should reste." These imaginary orations were the work of an Italian, who
  styled himself, in Latin, Banatusius Magnomontanus.</p>

  <p>After a time, the term Noblesse, which we here find synonymous with
  Honour, and (in p. <a href="#pagexv">xv</a>. <i>ante</i>) with Chivalry,
  in the sense of a class or order of society, <!-- Page lv --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pagelv"></a>{lv}</span>became obsolete as an
  English word. In the former sense, at least, it was changed into our
  English "Nobleness;" and about the year 1530 we find published a "Book of
  Noblenes," printed by Robert Wyer, without date.<a name="NtA80"
  href="#Nt80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> This work had been translated from Latin
  into French, and "now into English by John Larke." I have not seen it,
  but I imagine it was a far smaller and slighter composition than the
  present.<a name="NtA81" href="#Nt81"><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Ames<a name="NtA82" href="#Nt82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> mentioned our
  "Boke of Noblesse" as a printed work, on the authority of Tanner's MSS.,
  but this was evidently a misapprehension.</p>

  <p>It only now remains that I should describe the Manuscript, which is
  preserved in the Royal Collection at the British Museum, and marked 18 B.
  XXII.</p>

  <p>It is written in a paper book, which is formed of four quires of
  paper, each consisting of six sheets, and is of the size of a modern
  quarto volume. The quires are marked in the lower margin with the
  signatures of the scribe: the first quire consisting of six sheets,
  placed within one another, and marked j. ij. iij. iiij. v. vj.; the
  second also of six sheets, marked .a.i. .a.ij. .a.iij. .a.iiij. .a.v. and
  .a.vj.; the third, b.1. .b.3. .b.4. .b.5. .b.6.; the fourth .c.1. c.2.
  c.3. c.4. c.5. c.6. Thus it is seen that the sheet containing the leaf
  b.2. and the attached leaf (b.11. as it might be called) is lost: and
  this loss occasions the defects which will be found in the present volume
  at p. <a href="#page50">50</a> and p. <a href="#page68">68</a>.</p>

  <p>In front of the volume are bound three leaves of vellum, on the last
  of which is fastened a slip of the like material, inscribed,
  apparently</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

  Arundel, into whose <!-- Page lvi --><span class="pagenum"><a

  purchase in the reign of Elizabeth or James the First.</p>

  <p>On the leaf .c.2. is the autograph name of <i>Robert Savylle</i>.</p>

  <p>On the last leaf are many scribblings, and attempts in drawing
  grotesque heads and figures, apparently done about the time of queen

<h2>ADDITIONAL NOTES.</h2>

  <p>Page <a href="#pageliv">liv</a>. <i>De Regimine
  Principum.</i>&mdash;Sir John Paston (temp. Edw. IV.) had a copy of this
  work, which formed part of a volume which he thus described in the

  written the book, in his bill of accompt, which is also preserved in the

  <p>The "Treatise of Knighthood" here mentioned, may probably have
  resembled <i>The Booke of the Ordre of Chyvalrye or Knyghthode</i>
  printed by Caxton (see p. liv.); and the "Treatise of War" may have been
  a version of <i>The Boke of Fayttes of Armes and of Chyvallrye</i>, which
  Caxton also published from the <i>Arbre de Batailes</i>, &amp;c. as
  before noticed in p. vi.</p>

  <p>The "Othea pistill" was certainly the same book which passes under the
  name of Christine de Pisan, and which was printed at Paris by Philippe
  Pigouchet, in 4to, under the title of "<i>Les cent Histoires de
  troye.</i> Lepistre de Othea deesse de prudence enuoyee a lesperit
  cheualereux Hector de troye, auec cent hystoires." In every page of this
  book there is a <i>Texte</i> in French verse, and a <i>Glose</i> in
  prose, which agrees exactly with sir John Paston's description in his
  catalogue (where it appears as distinct from Ebesham's "Great Book,") in
  this entry,&mdash;"Item, a <i>Book de Othea</i>, text and glose, in

  accordithe withe the same, saieng in Latyn termes: "Res publica est res
  populi, res patriæ, res communis; sic patet quod omnis qui intendit bonum
  commune et utilitatem populi vel patriæ vel civitatis augere, conservare,
  protegere, salva justicia intendit et rempublicam augere et conservare."
  And it is forto lerne and considre to what vertues Respublica
  strecchithe, as I rede in a tretie that Wallensis, a noble clerk, wrote
  in his book clepid Commune loquium, C<sup>o</sup>. 3<sup>o</sup>.
  p<sup>e</sup> partis, seithe quod, "Respublica ordinatur hiis virtutibus,
  scilicet, legum rectitudine, justiciæ soliditate, equitatis concordia,
  unanimitatis fidelitate mutua adjuvante, concilio salubri dirigente,
  morum honestate decorante, ordinata intentione consumpnante." As for the
  first <span class="sidenotel">Tullius in nova rethorica.</span> partie it
  is verified by Tullie in his Rethorik the first booke: "Omnes leges ad
  commodum reipublicæ judicis referre oportet, et lex nichil aliud est quam
  recta racio et anima justa, imperans honesta, prohibens contraria." And
  it is right expedient that alle tho that be justices, governours, or
  rulers of contrees, citees, or townes, to a comon profit, must doo it by
  prudent counceile and good avise of auncien approved men; for a
  governoure of a comon profit were in olde tyme named amongis the Romayns,
  havyng the astate that at this daies bene used [by] alle tho that bene
  called to highe digniteis, the emperoure, kingis, princes, dukis,

<p class="cenhead">How auncient men growen in yeris be more acceptable to be elect

<div class="sidenotel">Tullius de Senectute.</div>

  profit of a citee, towne, or village, as to bere offices, than othirs
  that bene yong of age, althoughe he be [of] mighty power of bodie. For an
  example he puttithe, as there be men in a ship som that be yonge of
  mighty power halithe up the ankirs, othirs goithe feersly aboute the
  ropis fastenyng, and some goithe to set up the saile and take it downe as

  dothe more profit and grettir avauntage to the vesselle than alle tho
  yong lusty <span class="sidenotel">Experiencia, &amp;c.</span> men that
  rennen, halithe, or clymethe. Wherfor it may be concluded that the
  auncien approved men by long experience, made governours and counceilours
  of roiaumes, contrees, citeis, and townes, done grettir dedis by theire
  wise counceile, than tho that labouren in the feelde, cite, or towne by

  <p>Also I rede of a noble example in Titus Livius the .5. booke of the
  seconde decade of Punica bella, that whan the noble Romains, in the tyme

  gret chargis before that they might no more, but if the lordis senatours

  example to the comons for the defens of the contree of Cesille and keping
  of the lande and see <span class="sidenotel">Lenius.</span> frome
  ennemies. And one Lenius, a noble senatoure, pronounced and saide that,
  forasmoche the senatours have power of goode and rule of the cite in
  preferraunce of worship and dignite, in like wise it is reason that they
  here a charge to defende the comons and yeve example to doo as thow
  woldist comaunde hem to doo; therfore late us, in yevyng the comons
  example, to morne yn opyn market place before hem, bring forthe the gret
  part of the golde and silver of coyne and print money that every of us
  senatours and statis haven, so that none of us reserve and kepe to his
  propre use but ringis and nouches for to worship his wiffe and children
  withalle; so that every officer shulde have noo more silver vesselle but
  for a chapelle and a cupbourde; and every senatoure to kepe but a pounde

  citesyn of havyour and degre to reserve only but .v<sup>mil</sup>. pens
  of brasse money, and soo that alle othir golde, silver, and brasse money
  coyned to be brought to the tresorers of the citee. And aftre than the
  comons of Rome, havyng consideracion that the senatours and governours of
  Rome of here owne fre voulente haboundonned and put out so habundantlie
  and largelie of her golde and tresour for the comon wele, to the defense
  and keping of the see withe shippis and maryneris, to the defense and
  rebutting of her adversaries, that every of the comons of Rome, after her

  write the names of the noble citesins, ne forto nombre and telle the
  quantite and porcion of everie manis part that they broughte; and by this

  countre of Cecilians and Champenois, and also to be maistris of the see;
  and alle thingis and ordenaunces that longid to werre was purveied for

  <p><a name="Nt1" href="#NtA1">[1]</a> Giles brother to Francis I. duke of
  Bretagne. Having differences with his brother respecting his apanage, he
  was with the duke's consent arrested by king Charles VII.; and, perhaps
  in consequence of the English taking his part, he was put to death in the
  year 1450. His fate was commemorated in the "Histoire lamentable de
  Gilles seigneur de Chateaubriand et de Chantocé, prince du sang de France
  et de Bretagne, estranglé en prison par les ministres d'un favory." See
  Daru's Histoire de Bretagne, 1826, vol. ii. pp. 287 et seq.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt2" href="#NtA2">[2]</a> Sir Simon Morhier is one of the
  commissioners named for concluding a treaty with "our adversary of
  France," dated 28 July 1438. (Rymer, x. 709.) Monstrelet relates that at
  the battle of Rouvray, commonly called the battle of the Herrings, which
  took place during the siege of Orleans in 1428, the only man of note
  slain on the English side was one named Bresanteau, nephew to Simon
  Morhier provost of Paris.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt3" href="#NtA3">[3]</a> I do not find the name of this
  esquire in the memoirs of the Mansel family, privately printed in 1850,
  by William W. Mansell, esq. There were Mansels in Bretagne as well as in
  England.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt4" href="#NtA4">[4]</a> A description of the taking of Pont
  de l'Arche will be found in the <i>Histoire du roy Charles VII.</i>, by
  Alain Chartier. He states that from a hundred to six score Englishmen
  were there either killed or taken prisoners: "Entre les autres y fut
  prins le sire de Faucquembergue, qui d'aventure y estoit venu la nuict."
  This was William Neville, lord Fauconberg, a younger son of the first
  earl of Westmerland, and uncle to the King-making earl of Warwick.
  Dugdale describes his imprisonment on the authority of letters patent (30
  Hen. VI. p. 1, m. 24) whereby he was granted some compensation: "Being
  sent ambassador into Normandy, to treat of peace and truce betwixt both
  realms, he was most perfidiously seized upon by the French, and kept
  prisoner: in respect of which sufferings he had in 30 Hen. VI. an
  assignation of 4108<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> 10¼<i>d.</i> then in arrears to
  him for his pay whilst he was governor of Roxburgh, to be received out of
  the customs of wool, cloths, skins, lead, and other commodities, arising
  in the ports of Boston, Kingston upon Hull, and Ipswich." In 32 Hen. VI.
  (1453-4) he was still prisoner in France. (Baronage of England, i. 308,
  309.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt5" href="#NtA5">[5]</a> Fougères was a strongly fortified
  town, and was considered one of the keys of Bretagne. It was taken by
  surprise, in the night of the 23-24 of March 1448, by François de
  Surienne, on the part of the English: an event which was followed by very
  important results, for Charles VII. made it an excuse for resuming
  hostilities in order to protect the duke of Bretagne as his vassal and
  ally: the Constable of France Artur de Richemont, who was the duke's
  uncle, (but who had been opposed to the arrest of his nephew Giles,)
  recovered the captured town; the duke invaded Lower Normandy, whilst the
  king of France entered the upper province, and by a rapid series of
  successes they within fifteen months drove the English out of the
  country.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt6" href="#NtA6">[6]</a> Honoré Bonnet was prior of Salon in
  Provence, as is shown by his own dedication of the book to Charles VI.
  written during the sovereignty of Louis II. of Anjou in Provence, that
  is, from 1384 to 1390. In some of the early editions of the book the
  author's name was altered to Bonnor: its title is "Larbre des batailles.
  Sensuyt larbre des batailles qui traicte de plusieurs choses comme de
  leglise. Et aussi des faictz de la guerre. Et aussi c&#x14D;ment on se
  doyt gouuerner. Paris, 1493." folio. Also Paris, 1505, 4to. Among the
  Royal collection of Manuscripts in the British Museum (20 C. VIII.) is a
  magnificent copy in large folio, and another, in quarto, has been
  recently purchased (Addit. MS. 22,768.) Respecting others at Paris see
  the work of M. Paulin Paris on "Les Manuscrits Français de la
  Bibliothèque du Roi," vol. v. pp. 101, 307.</p>

  <p>On the fly-leaf of the Royal MS. is the following inscription in an
  old hand, the writer of which avowedly followed the <a
  href="#Nt151">note</a> at p. <a href="#page54">54</a> of the present
  volume:</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>L'Arbre des Battailles compose par Honore Bonet Prieur de Sallon en Prouuence.</i></p>

  <p>On the title-page are the autograph inscriptions of two of the former
  owners of the volume, <i>Sum Humfridi LLoyd</i> and <i>Lumley</i>: and at
  the end is inscribed <i>Iste liber constat Joh'i Gamston' Generoso</i>.
  It seems not improbable that the entry above extracted was written by
  Lord Lumley.</p>

  <i>France</i>, tome xx. p. 26, (1840, folio,) will be found the
  Instructions of king Louis to his Son, in their vernacular language. A
  copy of them, headed "Ce sont les enseignemens que mons<sup>r</sup>

  the College of Arms which contains many things about sir John Fastolfe.

  <p><a name="Nt8" href="#NtA8">[8]</a> Vegetius was a great authority with
  the writers of the middle ages. Monstrelet commences the prologue to the
  second volume of his chronicles by citing the book of "un trèsrenommé
  philosophe nommé Végèce, qu'il feist de la vaillance et prudence de
  chevalerie." The treatise of Vegetius de Re Militari had been translated
  into French about the year 1284, by Jean de Meun, one of the authors of
  the Roman de la Rose. In the fifteenth century it was one of the
  principal sources of a book entitled "Lart de cheualerie selon Vegece;
  lequel trait de la maniere que les princes doiuent tenir au fait de leurs
  guerres et batailles." This was printed at Paris by Anthoine Verard in
  1488; and it was, at the command of king Henry VII. translated by Caxton,
  and printed by him at Westminster in the following year, as "The Fayttes
  of Armes and of Chyvallrye," which (he states in his colophon,)
  "Christian of Pise made and drew out of the book named Vegecius de Re
  Militari, and out of the Arbre of Battles." Now, Christina de Pisan was a
  poetess: and it is not likely that she had more to do with this treatise
  on the art of war than the "dame Christine" of our present author had
  with the Arbre des Batailles. Indeed it is probable that the two
  misappropriations are connected in their origin. On the actual
  productions of Christine de Pisan, which furnished other works to our
  first English printer, see the description by M. Paulin Paris of "Les
  Manuscrits Français de la Bibliothèque du Roi," vol. iv. 184, vol. v.
  148-185, vi. 359, 399: and an "Essai sur les Ecrits Politiques de
  Christine de Pisan, suivi d'une Notice Litteraire et de Pièces Inédites.
  Par Raimond Thomassy, 1838." 8vo. pp. 200.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt9" href="#NtA9">[9]</a> Alain Chartier was a writer both in
  prose and poetry. There are separate editions of several of his works:
  and a collected volume of them was edited by Andrew du Chesne in 1617. An
  English translation of his "Curial" was printed by Caxton without date.
  See an account of various manuscripts of the works of Chartier given by
  M. Paulin Paris in his vol. vi. pp. 385-387, vol. vii. pp. 251-254.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt10" href="#NtA10">[10]</a> The personages speaking in the
  Quadrilogue are France, Le Peuple, Le Chevalier, and Le Clergie, to whose
  conversation l'Acteur, or the Author, occasionally interposes some
  remarks. Le Chevalier is also the Gendarmerie, and described as being
  identical with the Estat de Noblesse&mdash;an identity which is thus
  maintained at the beginning of the reign of Henry the Eighth:&mdash;"in
  all the Chevalrie of this realme, wherein be intended all Dukes, Erles,
  Barons, Knightes, Esquires, and other Gentlemen by office or
  aucthoritie." I quote this from The Tree of Common Wealth, by Edmonde
  Dudley, (written in 1509 or 1510,) printed for the Brotherhood of the
  Rosy Cross, at Manchester, 1859, p. 18.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt12" href="#NtA12">[12]</a> This battle, from which the
  final loss of Normandy ensued, was fought at Formigny, between Charenton
  and Bayeux, on the 15th of April 1450. Sir Thomas Kyriell, who was there
  taken prisoner, was a veteran warrior of Agincourt, and had for some
  years been lieutenant of Calais. By a writ of privy seal dated the 12th
  August 1451, Henry VI. granted the sum of 5000 crowns and lent another
  5000, out of the bonds due from the duke of Orleans, in order to provide
  for the ransom of sir Thomas Kyriell. (Rymer, xi. 287.) Sir Thomas was
  elected a Knight of the Garter at the close of the reign of Henry the
  Sixth, Feb. 8, 1460-1, and beheaded by the victorious Yorkists on the
  18th of the same month.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt13" href="#NtA13">[13]</a> This passage was an abridgment
  from one in <i>Le Quadrilogue Invectif</i> of Alain Chartier: which is as
  follows: "Toutes anciennes escriptures sont plaines de mutations,
  subversions, et changemens de Royaulmes et des Principaultez. Car comme
  les enfans naissent et croissent en hommes parfaitz, et puis declinent à
  vieillesse et à mort; ainsi ont les Seigneuries leur commencement, et
  leur accroissement, et leur declin. Où est Ninive la grant cité, qui
  duroit trois journées de chemin? Qu'est devenue Babiloine, qui fut
  edifiée de matiere artificieuse pour plus durer aux hommes, et maintenant
  est habitée de serpens? Que dira l'en de Troye la riche et tres renommée?
  Et de Ylion le chastel sans per, dont les portes furent d'ivoire, et les
  colonnes d'argent; et maintenant à peine en reste le pié des fondemens,
  que les haulx buissons forcloent de la veue des hommes? Thebes qui fut
  fondée de Cadmus le fils de Agenor, et la plus peuplée de dessus la terre
  pour son temps: en laquelle part pourroit en trouver tant de reliques de
  son nom, que gens se puissent monstrer nez de sa semence? Lacedemoine,
  dont les loix vindrent à diverse nations, desquelles encores nous usons,
  ne peut oncques tant estroictement garder les loix de Licurgus le
  doicturier, qui furent faictes pour sa perpetuation, que sa vertu ne soit
  extaincte et aneantie. Athenes fontaine de sapience, et source des
  haultes doctrines de philosophie, n'est elle pas en subversion, et les
  ruisseaulx de son escole taris et asseichez? Carthage la batailleresse,
  qui domptait les elephans à batailler, et qui jadis fut tant redoubtée
  aux Romains, où a elle tourné sa grant glorie, sinon en la cendre du feu
  où elle fut arse et embrasée? Mais parlons de Romme, qui fut derreniere
  en souveraine majesté, et excellente en vertu. Et notons bien la parolle
  de Lucan, qui dit que de elle mesme par sa pesanteur elle decheut. Car
  les trops pesans faiz font les plus griefues cheoistes. Par ceste maniere
  chascune à sa tour et en son ordre se changent, rebaissent, ou
  soubvertissent les eureuses fortunes, et le bruit des Royaulmes. Ainsi
  comme la Monarchie du monde et la dignité du Souverain Empire fut jadis
  translatée des Assiriens aux Persans, des Persans aux Grecz, des Grecz
  aux Rommains, et des Rommains es mains des François et des Germains."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt14" href="#NtA14">[14]</a> It was in this sense that the
  duke of Burgundy was called Charles le Hardi, which was equivalent to the
  modern <i>le Temeraire</i>, that is, not only Bold, but Rash. We find
  that the author of <i>L'Arbre des Batailles</i> discusses in his third
  book, chapter viii., the various causes from which "est ung chevalier
  bien hardy:" and he asserts them to be many: "Car premierement ung
  chevalier sera hardy pour avoir et conquerir vaine gloire et l'honneur de
  ce monde: pour ce seulement quil voit les hardis honnourez et le couhars
  dishonnourez. Ung autre chevalier sera hardy pour avoir peur de perdre
  honneur et proffit de son seigneur, et pour peur destre prins sil estoit
  couhart. La tierce par usaige; car se ung chevalier a grant temps porté
  le harnois il seulement qui scaurra bien l'usaige prandra ardement in ce
  quon ne parle contre lun sil faisoit le contraire. Aultre chevalier y a
  qui est hardy pour ce quil sent son harnois et armeures estre bons et de
  bonne espreuve. Aultre chevalier y a qui est hardy pour son cappitaine
  quil scet estre bien sage et bien fortuné. Aultre chevalier y a qui est
  hardy par droicte fureur, et par droicte coulere hayreuse. Aultre
  chevalier y a qui est hardy par ignorance: car il est si simple quil ne
  scet que est vertu de force: mais faite ainsi comme il voit faire au plus
  avance. Aultre chevalier y a qui est hardy par couvoitise de gaigner
  richesses et non pour aultre chose. Or saiches maintenant comme en toutes
  ces hardiesses na vertu si non en cellui qui est hardy de droicte
  congnoissance et de droit scavoir, et ayt la voulente entendue a vertu et
  a justice et ferme voulenté d'attendre et de soustenir toute chose deue
  et possible par la vertu de force. Et te souffise de ceste vertu quant à

  <p><a name="Nt15" href="#NtA15">[15]</a> Jean de Villiers, seigneur de
  l'Isle Adam et de Villiers le Bel, having joined the party of the duke of
  Burgundy, was by his influence made Maréchal of France in 1418. He was
  arrested by the duke of Exeter at Paris in 1420, and released by the duke
  of Bedford in 1422, at the request of Philip duke of Burgundy. By duke
  Charles he was highly favoured, made one of the first knights of the
  order of the Golden Fleece, and captain of Paris when the duke of Bedford
  left that city in 1430. He was killed during a popular commotion at
  Bruges in 1437. See his life in Anselme's Histoire Genealogique, 1723,
  vii. 10.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt16" href="#NtA16">[16]</a> The account which Monstrelet
  gives of this insurrection entirely corresponds with that of our author.
  It is as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"En apres le duc d'Excestre, qui estoit capitaine de Paris, pour
  certaines causes qui à ce le meurent, feit prendre en icelle ville le
  seigneur de l'Isle Adam par aucuns de ses Anglois: pour laquelle prinse
  s'assemblerent jusques a mille hommes ou plus du commun de Paris, pour le
  rescourre à ceux qui le menoient en la bastille S. Anthoine. Mais tantost
  ledit duc d'Excestre à tout six vingts combattans, dont il y avoit la
  plus grand partie archiers, alla frapper en eux et faire tirer les
  dessusdits archiers au travers desdites communes: pourquoy tant par la
  cremeur dudict traict, comme par le commandement qu'il leur feit de par
  le Roy, se retrahirent assez brief en leurs maisons: et ledit seigneur de
  l'Isle Adam fut (comme dit est) mis prisonnier, et y demoura durant la
  vie du roy Henry d'Angleterre, lequel l'eust faict mourir, ce n'eust esté
  la requeste du duc de Bourgongne." (Chroniques de Monstrelet, vol. i.
  chap. ccxxxviii.)</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><a name="Nt17" href="#NtA17">[17]</a> It is very remarkable how
  entirely these statements correspond with some passages of Commines,
  (book iv. chap. xviii.) in which he describes the conduct of tyrannical
  princes, and the way in which France especially suffered from quartering
  soldiers. "To the common people they leave little or nothing, though
  their taxes be greater than they ought to be; nor do they take any care
  to restrain the licentiousness of their soldiers, who are constantly
  quartered throughout the country without paying anything, and commit all
  manner of excesses and insolencies, as everybody knows; for, not
  contented with the ordinary provisions with which they are supplied, they
  beat and abuse the poor country people, and force them to bring bread,
  wine, and other dainties, on purpose for their eating; and if the
  goodman's wife or daughter happens to be good-looking, his wisest course
  is to keep her out of their sight. And yet, where money is abundant, it
  would be no difficult matter to prevent this disorder and confusion, by
  paying them every two months at furthest, which would obviate the
  pretence of want of pay, and leave them without excuse, and cause no
  inconvenience to the prince, because his money is raised punctually every
  year. I say this in compassion to this kingdom, which certainly is more
  oppressed and harassed in quartering soldiers than any in all
  Europe."</p>

  memoir on the Scrope and Grosvenor Roll (ii. 347), has remarked "the
  slighting manner in which the profession of the law is mentioned, in
  comparison with that of arms," in the deposition of sir William Aton.
  Speaking of sir Henry Scrope, that witness stated that he was come of
  noble and gentle ancestry, and yet by the consent of his parents was put
  to the law, and became the king's justice, but nevertheless used in his
  halls, on his beds, in windows, and on plate the arms of <i>Azure, a bend
  or</i>. At a much later date (1542) sir Edmund Knightley, though a
  younger brother and a serjeant at law, is represented in a full suit of
  armour at Fawsley, co. Northampton. His epitaph commemorates both his
  gentilitial and his professional merits:</p>

  <p>But, whilst these passages are certainly indicative of the prevailing
  chivalric sentiments, it is still to be remembered that very absurd
  class-prejudices exist in all ages, and they must not always be taken in
  proof of the general opinions of society. It is indisputable that, from
  the Conquest downwards, the "younger brothers" of some of our greatest
  families have been bred to the law, and the inns of court were always the
  resort of young men of noble birth.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt23" href="#NtA23">[23]</a> Commines gives the following
  somewhat satirical account of an English parliament. "The king was not
  able to undertake such an affair without calling his parliament, which is
  in the nature of our Three Estates, and, consisting for the most part of
  sage and religious men, is very serviceable and a great strengthening to
  the king. At the meeting of this parliament the king declares his
  intention, and desires aid of his subjects, for no money is raised in
  England but upon some expedition into France or Scotland, and then they
  supply him very liberally, especially against France. Yet the kings of
  England have this artifice when they want money, and have a desire to
  have any supplies granted,&mdash;to raise men, and pretend quarrels with
  Scotland or France, and, having encamped with their army for about three
  months, to disband it, return home, and keep the remainder of the money
  for their own private use; and this trade king Edward understood very
  well, and often practised it."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt24" href="#NtA24">[24]</a> At that time the parliament
  first granted the number of 20,000 archers, which was afterwards reduced
  to 13,000. Rot. Parl. v. 230, 231.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt27" href="#NtA27">[27]</a> Ibid. p. 39.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt28" href="#NtA28">[28]</a> The parliament re-assembled
  accordingly on the 9th of May 1474: and during that session, on the 18th
  of July, the commons again granted to the king a quinsisme and a disme (a
  fifteenth and a tenth), and the further sum of 51,147<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i>
  7¾<i>d.</i> in full payment of the wages of the 13,000 archers, who,
  notwithstanding the condition of the former grants, were still maintained
  in readiness for the proposed expedition. In making these votes, the
  commons recited, as before, the king's intention to set outward a mighty
  army, "as dyvers tymes by the mouth of your chancellors for the tyme
  beyng hath to us been declared and shewed;" and it was now ordained
  "that, if the said viage roiall hold not afore the feste of seynt John
  Baptist the year of our Lord M cccclxvj. that then aswell the graunte of
  the forsaid xiij M. men as of all the sommes severally graunted for the
  wages of the same," should be utterly void and of none effect, (Rot.
  Parl. vi. 111, 118.) On the re-assembling of parliament in January 1474-5
  a further act was passed to hasten the payment of the disme first voted
  (Ibid. p. 120); and again, on the 14th of March, immediately before the
  dissolution of the parliament, the commons granted another fifteenth and
  tenth, and three parts of a fifteenth and tenth, to provide for the
  before-mentioned sum of 51,147<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i> 7¾<i>d.</i> (Ibid. pp.
  149, 153.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt29" href="#NtA29">[29]</a> They are printed in Rymer's
  F&oelig;dera, &amp;c. vol. xi. pp. 804 et seq.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt30" href="#NtA30">[30]</a> An account of the payment of
  these wages for the first quarter, is preserved on the pell records of
  the Exchequer, and an abstract printed in Rymer's F&oelig;dera, vol. xi.
  p. 844. It includes the names of the dukes of Clarence, Norfolk, and
  Suffolk, the earls of Ormonde and Northumberland, the lords Grey, Scrope,
  Ferrers, Stanley, Fitzwarren, Hastynges, Lisle, and Cobham, and as
  bannerets sir Ralph Hastings, sir Thomas Mountgomery, and sir John
  Astley; besides the earl of Douglas and the lord Boyd, noblemen of
  Scotland; with many knights, esquires, and officers of the king's
  household.</p>

  <p>The item to the duke of Clarence will afford a specimen of these
  payments: "Georgio duci Clarentiæ pro Cxx hominibus ad arma, seipso
  computato ut Duce ad xiijs. iiij d. per diem, et pro viginti eorum
  Militum quilibet ad ij s. per diem, et xcix aliis Hominibus ad Arma
  quilibet ad xij d. per diem et vj d. ultra de regardo, et pro mille
  Sagittariis [2275li.</p>

  <p>Summa totalis,] MMMCxciij l. vj s. x d.</p>

  <p>The payments to the Duke of Gloucester (omitted by Rymer, but
  extracted in Devon's Issues of the Exchequer, 1837, p. 498,) were nearly
  to the same amount, viz. For 116 Men at Arms, to himself as a Duke at 13
  s. 4 d. per day, 60 l. 13 s. 4 d.; for six Knights, to each of them 2 s.
  per day, 54 l. 12 s.; to each of the remainder of the said 116 Men at
  Arms 12 d. per day, and 6 d. per day as a reward,&mdash;743 l. 18 s. 6
  d.; and to 950 Archers, to each of them 6 d. per day, 2161 l. 6
  s.&mdash;Total 3020 l. 8 s. 10 d.</p>

  <p>Rymer has also (vol. xi. pp. 817-819) given at length three specimens
  of the indentures made with several persons. The first (dated 20 August
  1474) is an indenture retaining sir Richard Tunstall to serve the king
  for one whole year in his duchy of Normandy and realm of France, with ten
  speres, himself accompted, and one hundred archers well and sufficiently
  abiled, armed and arraied, taking wages for hymself of ij s. by the day,
  for everiche of the said speres xij d. by the day, and rewardes of vj d.
  by the day for everich of the said other speres, and for everich of the
  said archers vj d. by the day. The next is an indenture made (on the 13th
  November) with Thomas Grey esquire, "for one whole year, as a custrell to
  attend about the king our soveraine lord's own persone, and with six
  archers well and sufficiently abled, armed, and arraied," his pay being
  xij d. by the day, an additional vj d. by the day by "meane of reward,"
  and vj d. a day for each of his archers. The third is the indenture made
  with Richard Garnet esquire, serjeant of the king's tents, who was
  retained for the like term to do service of war "as a man of armes at his
  spere, with xxiiij yomen well and sufficiently habiled, armed and
  arraied," taking wages himself iiij s. a day, for two of the yeomen each
  xij d. a day, and for the remainder each vj d. a day.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt39" href="#NtA39">[39]</a> Monstrelet in his Chronicle
  attempts to present a list of the principal English lords and knights
  (the latter more than fifty in number), but every name is so disfigured
  that they are almost past recognition: as the names he gives to the
  nobility will show. He calls them, the dukes of Sufflocq and Noirflocq,
  the earls of Crodale (Arundel?), Nortonbellan, Scersebry, (Shrewsbury,
  and not as Buchon his editor suggests Salisbury, which title did not then
  exist,) Willephis (Wiltshire?), and Rivière; the lords Stanlay,
  Grisrufis, Gray, Erdelay, Ondelay, Verton, Montu, Beguey, Strangle,
  Havart, and Caubehem. The last name (Cobham) and that of lord Fitzwaren
  are among the indentures printed by Rymer in his vol. xi. pp. 844-848,

  English army during the months of July and August.</p>

  <p>"Le 6. Juillet la duchesse de Bourgoyne, qui avoit été presque

  <p>"Le 14. ce duc arriva à Calais vers le roy d'Angleterre, qui le

  en partit le 24. après déjeuner, et alla disner, soupper, et coucher en
  la cité d'Arras; et ce jour il mangea du poisson, à cause de la veille de
  Sainct Jacques. Le 27. il partit d'Arras après disner, et alla coucher à
  Dourlens. Il en partit le 29. après disner, et alla voir l'ost du roy
  d'Angleterre, et coucher en le cense de Hamencourt: la duchesse partit ce
  jour de Sainct Omer, pour retourner à Gand, où mademoiselle de Bourgoyne
  étoit restée.</p>

  <p>"Le mardy premier Août, ce duc disna en la cense de Hamencourt, coucha
  au village d'Aichen, près l'ost du roy d'Angleterre. Il en partit le 2.

  coucha a Curleu sur Somme, près ledit ost. Il y disna le 6. passa par

  qu'il en partit après disner, passa par l'ost du roy d'Angleterre, et
  alla coucher à Cambray. Il y disna le 13. et coucha à Valenciennes, d'où
  il partit le 18. après disner, souppa à Cambray, et alla coucher à
  Peronne. Il y disna le 20. alla encore voir le roy d'Angleterre au mesme
  camp, et alla coucher à Cambray. Le 21. il disna à Valenciennes, coucha à
  Mons. Le 22. il disna à Nivelle, et coucha à Namur, où les ambassadeurs
  de Naples, Arragon, Venise, et autres se rendirent. Le 29. Août,

  <p><a name="Nt42" href="#NtA42">[42]</a> The fact of earl Rivers having
  repaired to the duke of Burgundy <i>once</i>, at the end of April, is
  confirmed by the chronicle formed from the journals of the duke's
  <i>maistres d'hoste</i>: "Le 29. de ce mois (Avril) le sire de Riviers,
  ambassadeur du roy d'Angleterre, arriva vers ce duc, et en fut regalé."
  (Appendix to the edition of Commines, by the Abbé Lenglet du Fresnoy,
  4to. 1747, ii. 216.) But in the previous January we read, "The King's
  ambassadors, sir Thomas Mountgomery and the Master of the Rolls (doctor
  Morton), be coming homeward from Nuys." (Paston Letters, vol. ii. p.
  175.)</p>

  Commines's narrative, on mentioning this English herald, adds, "whome
  Argenton (meaning Commines,) untrewly calleth Garter borne in Normandy,
  for the rome of Gartier was never geven to no estraunger." The office of
  Garter was at this time occupied by John Smert, who was appointed in 28
  Hen. VI. and died in 18 Edw. IV. He was the son-in-law of Bruges his
  predecessor in the office: and there are large materials for his
  biography in Anstis's Collections on the heralds, at the College of Arms,
  but containing no evidence either to prove Commines's assertion, or
  Hall's denial, of his being a native of Normandy.</p>

  de Luxembourg, comte de St. Pol. After temporising between Burgundy and
  France at this crisis, he paid the penalty for his vacillation, the duke
  surrendering him to Louis, by whom he was decapitated before the end of
  the year (Dec. 19, 1475).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt46" href="#NtA46">[46]</a> Jacqueline duchess of Bedford,
  the mother of the queen of England, was one of the constable's sisters.
  The constable was also connected by marriage with king Louis, who called
  him "brother" from their having married two sisters. The relationship of
  all the principal actors in the transactions described in the text is

  July, and near Aichen on the 1st of August. Its position near Peronne is
  believed to have been at St. Christ, on the river Somme, and it appears
  to have remained there for a considerable time.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt50" href="#NtA50">[50]</a> The duke was at Peronne from the

  <p><a name="Nt52" href="#NtA52">[52]</a> The prudent and conciliatory
  conduct of Louis XI. towards the English at this crisis seems to have had
  a precedent in that of his ancestor Charles V. "Le sage roy de France
  Charles quint du nom, quant on lui disait que grant honte estoit de
  recouvrer des forteresses par pecune, que les Anglois à tort tenoient,
  comme il eust assez puissance pour les ravoir par force, Il me semble

  <p><a name="Nt55" href="#NtA55">[55]</a> Lord Hastings was previously a
  pensioner of the duke of Burgundy. Lenglet du Fresnoy has published a
  letter of the duke granting to William lord Hastings a yearly pension of
  1000 crowns of Flanders, dated at the castle of Peronne, 4 May 1471; a
  receipt of lord Hastings for that sum on the 12th July 1474; and another
  receipt for 1200 livres of Flanders, dated 12th April 1475. (Mémoires de
  P. de Commines, 1745, iii. 616, 619.) Commines, in his Sixth Book,
  chapter ii. relates how he had himself been the agent who had secured
  lord Hastings to the Burgundian interest, and how he subsequently
  negociated with him on the part of king Louis. Hastings accepted the
  French pension, being double the amount of the Burgundian, but on this
  occasion, according to Commines, would give no written acknowledgment. In
  an interview with the French emissary, Pierre Cleret, of which Commines
  in his Book VI. chapter ii. gives the particulars at some length, he said
  the money might be put in his sleeve. Cleret left it, without
  acquittance; and his conduct was approved by his master.</p>

  halfe white, which weyed xvij. nobles every cuppe or more." Fabyan's
  Chronicle.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt57" href="#NtA57">[57]</a> This passionate interview must
  have taken place on the 19th or 20th of August: see the <a
  href="#Nt40">note</a> on the Duke's movements in p. <a
  href="#pagexxiv">xxiv</a>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt58" href="#NtA58">[58]</a> We are continuing to follow the
  account of Commines. But the truce, which was not yet concluded, was made
  for seven years only; and the dukes of Burgundy and Britany were not
  mentioned in the articles. The duke of Burgundy, shortly after, himself
  made a truce with France for nine years. It was dated on the 13th of
  September, only fifteen days after that of the English.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt59" href="#NtA59">[59]</a> Molinet says, "de quatrevingts à
  cent chariots de vin."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt60" href="#NtA60">[60]</a> The real Childermas day was on
  the 28th of December; but sir John Fenn, the editor of the Paston
  Letters, has suggested that the 28th of every month was regarded as a
  Childermas day; for the 28th of June, 1461, being Childermas, and
  consequently a day of unlucky omen, was avoided for the coronation of
  Edward the Fourth. From other authorities it appears that the day of the
  week on which Childermas occurred was regarded as unfortunate throughout
  the year.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt61" href="#NtA61">[61]</a> Molinet mentions three other
  names, those of the admiral, the seigneur de Craon, and the mayor of
  Amiens.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt62" href="#NtA62">[62]</a> According to our London
  historian, Fabyan, Louis's attire was by no means becoming:</p>

  <p>"Of the nyse and wanton disguysed apparayll (he says) that the kynge
  Lowys ware upon hym at the tyme of this metynge I myght make a longe
  rehersayl: but for it shulde sownde more to dishonour of suche a noble
  man, that was apparaylled more lyke a mynstrell than a prynce royall,
  therfor I passe it over."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt63" href="#NtA63">[63]</a> Commines saw king Edward at the
  Burgundian court in 1470. On that occasion he gives him this brief
  character: "King Edward was not a man of any great management or
  foresight, but of an invincible courage, and the most beautiful prince my
  eyes ever beheld."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt64" href="#NtA64">[64]</a> The documents which bear date on
  the day of the royal interview are these, as printed in the edition of
  Commines by the Abbé Lenglet du Fresnoy, 1747, 4to. vol. iii:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. The treaty of truce for seven years between Edward king of France
  and England and lord of Ireland and his allies on the one part, and the
  most illustrious prince Louis of France (not styled king) and his allies,
  on the other. (In Latin.) Dated in a field near Amiens on the 29th August
  1475. The conservators of the truce on the part of the king of England
  were the dukes of Clarence and Gloucester, the chancellor of England, the
  keeper of the privy seal, the warden of the cinque ports, and the captain
  or deputy of Calais for the time being; on the part of the prince of
  France his brother Charles comte of Beaujeu and John bastard of Bourbon
  admiral of France.</p>

  <p>2. Obligation of Louis king of the French to pay to Edward king of
  England yearly, in London, during the life of either party, the sum of
  50,000 crowns. (In Latin.) Dated at Amiens on the 29th of August.</p>

  <p>3. A treaty of alliance between king Edward and Louis of France (in
  Latin) stipulating, 1. that if either of them were driven from his
  kingdom, he should be received in the states of the other, and assisted
  to recover it. 2. to name commissioners of coinage, which should
  circulate in their dominions respectively. 3. that prince Charles, son of
  Louis, should marry Elizabeth daughter of the king of England, or, in
  case of her decease, her sister Mary. Dated in the field near Amiens, on
  the 29th of August.</p>

  <p>4. Another part of the treaty, bearing the same date, appointing for
  the arbiters of all differences, on the part of the king of England his
  uncle the cardinal Thomas archbishop of Canterbury and his brother George
  duke of Clarence, and on the part of Louis of France, Charles archbishop
  of Lyons and John comte de Dunois.</p>

  <p>In April 1478 the three years were prolonged by another like term to
  the 29th August 1481; the letters patent relative to which are printed
  ibid. p. 536.</p>

  <p>On the 13th Feb. 1478-9 the truce was renewed for the lives of both
  princes, and for one hundred years after the decease of either, king
  Louis obliging himself and his successors to continue the payment of the
  50,000 crowns during that term: the documents relating to this
  negotiation are printed ibid. pp. 560&mdash;570.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt65" href="#NtA65">[65]</a> Molinet, in his account of the
  conference, states that it lasted for an hour and a half, and that a
  principal topic of discussion was the conduct of the constable, Louis
  showing a letter, in which the constable had engaged to harass the
  English army as soon as it was landed.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt66" href="#NtA66">[66]</a> This Gascon gentleman is a
  person of some interest, from his name being mentioned by Caxton. He was
  resident at the English court, as a servant of Anthony lord Scales (the
  queen's brother) as early as the year 1466, when in a letter, dated at
  London, on the 16th of June, he challenged sir Jehan de Chassa, a knight
  in the retinue of the duke of Burgundy, to do battle with him in honour
  of a noble lady of high estimation, immediately after the performance of
  the intended combat in London between the lord Scales and the bastard of
  Burgundy. His letter of challenge, in which he terms the king of England
  his sovereign lord, is printed in the Excerpta Historica, 1831, p. 216;
  and that of sir Jehan de Chassa accepting it at p. 219, addressed, <i>A
  treshonnouré escueire Louys de Brutallis</i>. His own signature is
  <i>Loys de Brutalljs</i>. The encounter is thus noticed in the Annals of
  William of Wyrcestre: "Et iij<sup>o</sup> die congressi sunt pedestres in
  campo, in præsencia regis, Lodowicus Bretailles cum &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Burgundiæ; deditque Rex honorem ambobus, attamen Bretailles
  habuit se melius in campo:" and thus by Olivier de la Marche: "On the
  morrow Messire Jehan de Cassa and a Gascon squire named Louis de
  Brettailles, servant of Mons. d'Escalles, did arms on foot: and they
  accomplished these arms without hurting one another much. And on the
  morrow they did arms on horseback; wherein Messire Jean de Chassa had
  great honour, and was held for a good runner at the lance." Lowys de
  Bretaylles, as his name is printed by Caxton, was still attendant upon
  the same nobleman, then earl Rivers, in 1473, when he went to the
  pilgrimage of St. James in Galicia; and upon that occasion, soon after
  sailing from Southampton, he lent to the earl the Book of <i>Les Dictes
  Moraux des Philosophes</i>, written in French by Johan de Tronville,
  which the earl translated, and caused it to be printed by Caxton, as
  <i>The Dicts and Sayings of the Philosophers</i>, in 1477.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt67" href="#NtA67">[67]</a> Fabyan's Chronicle.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt68" href="#NtA68">[68]</a> The former importance and power
  of the constable are thus described by Commines: "Some persons may
  perhaps hereafter ask, Whether the king alone was not able to have ruined
  him? I answer, No; for his territories lay just between those of the king
  and the duke of Burgundy: he had St. Quintin always, and another strong
  town in Vermandois: he had Ham and Bohain, and other considerable places
  not far from St. Quintin, which he might always garrison with what troops
  (and of what country) he pleased. He had four hundred of the king's men
  at arms, well paid; was commissary himself, and made his own
  musters,&mdash;by which means he feathered his nest very well, for he
  never had his complement. He had likewise a salary of forty-five thousand
  francs, and exacted a crown upon every pipe of wine that passed into
  Hainault or Flanders through any of his dominions; and, besides all this,
  he had great lordships and possessions of his own, a great interest in
  France, and a greater in Burgundy, on account of his kinsmen."</p>

  <p><a name="Nt69" href="#NtA69">[69]</a> None had actually been made with
  Burgundy by the treaty of the 29th of August. Commines certainly wrote
  under a misapprehension in that respect, as well as upon the number of
  years of the truce with England.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt70" href="#NtA70">[70]</a> Besides the lady Margaret there
  were two sons: Maximilian, afterwards the emperor Maximilian, and Philip.
  There was a contract of marriage in 1479 between the latter and the lady
  Anne of England, one of the daughters of Edward the Fourth. (Rymer, xii.
  110.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt71" href="#NtA71">[71]</a> Margaret herself was eventually
  rejected by Charles VIII. who was nearly nine years her senior. When he
  had the opportunity of marrying the heiress of Bretagne, and thereby
  annexing that duchy to France, Margaret was sent back to her father in
  1493, and afterwards married in 1497 to John infante of Castile, and in
  1501 to Philibert duke of Savoy. She subsequently nearly yielded to the
  suit of Charles Brandon lord Lisle, (afterwards the husband of Mary queen
  dowager of France,) who was made duke of Suffolk by his royal master in
  order to be more worthy of her acceptance; but at last she died childless
  in 1530, after a widowhood of six and twenty years, and a long and
  prosperous reign as regent of the Netherlands.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt73" href="#NtA73">[73]</a> "Whiche book was translated and

  Fraunce Duc of Bedforde, Thomas duc of Excestre, Thomas duc of Clarence,
  and other lyeutenauntes." This may be considered as a grateful tribute
  from William of Worcestre, when himself advanced in years (he died in or
  about 1484), to the memory of his ancient master, sir John Fastolfe, who
  had died in 1460. The biography of William of Worcestre was written by
  the Rev. James Dallaway in the Retrospective Review, vol. xvi. p. 451;
  and reprinted in 4to. 1823, in his volume entitled "William Wyrcestre
  redivivus: Notices of Ancient Church Architecture, particularly in
  Bristol," &amp;c.; but the latest and most agreeable sketch of
  Worcestre's life is that given by Mr. G. Poulett Scrope in his History of
  Castle Combe, 1852, 4to.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt74" href="#NtA74">[74]</a> He has recorded that in 1473 he
  presented a copy of his translation to bishop Waynflete,&mdash;"but
  received no reward!" His version was not made from the original, but from
  the French of Laurentius de Primo Facto, or du Premier-Faict: an
  industrious French translator, who flourished from 1380 to 1420.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt75" href="#NtA75">[75]</a> Bale, in his list of the works
  of Worcestre, whom he notices under his <i>alias</i> of Botoner, mentions
  <i>Acta Domini Joannis Fastolf</i>, lib. <span class="scac">I</span>,
  (commencing) "Anno Christi 1421, et anno regni&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Oldys (in the Biographia Britannica, 1750, p. 1907) attributes to
  Worcestre "a particular treatise, gratefully preserving the life and
  deeds of his master, under the title of <i>Acta Domini Johannis
  Fastolff</i>, which we hear is still in being, and has been promised the
  publick;" but in the second edition of Oldys's life of Fastolfe
  (Biographia Britannica, 1793, v. 706), we find merely this note
  substituted: "This is mentioned in the Paston Letters, iv. p. 78." The
  letter there printed is one addressed by John Davy to his master John
  Paston esquire after sir John Fastolfe's death. It relates to inquiries
  made of one "Bussard" for evidences relative to Fastolfe's estate; and it
  thus concludes: "he seyth the last tyme that he wrot on to William
  Wusseter it was beffor myssomyr, and thanne he wrote a Cronekyl of
  Jerewsalem and the Jornes that my mayster dede whyl he was in Fraunce,
  that God on his sowle have mercy, and he seyth that this drew more than
  xx whazerys (quires) off paper, and this wrytyng delyvered onto
  Wursseter, and non other, ne knowyth not off non other be is feyth." It
  appears, I think, very clearly that this passage was misunderstood by
  Oldys, or his informant, and that the historian of the "journeys" and
  valiant acts of sir John Fastolfe was not Worcestre, but the person
  called Bussard. It is not impossible that the person whom John Davy meant
  by that name was Peter Basset, who is noticed in the next page.</p>

  <p>Mr. Benjamin Williams, in the Preface to "Henrici Quinti Gesta,"
  (printed for the English Historical Society, 1850,) says of Worcestre
  that "he wrote the <i>Acts of Sir John Fastolfe</i>, contained in the
  volume from which this chronicle is extracted," <i>i.e.</i> the Arundel
  MS. <span class="scac">XLVIII</span>. in the College of Arms; but that
  statement appears to have been carelessly made, without ascertaining that
  the volume contained any such "Acts." "Also (Mr. Williams adds) the
  <i>Acts of John Duke of Bedford</i> (MS. Lambeth);" but those "Acts"
  again are not an historical or biographical memoir, but a collection of
  state papers and documents relating to the English occupation of France,
  which will be found described in Archdeacon Todd's Catalogue of the
  Lambeth Manuscripts as No. 506. Its contents are nearly identical with
  those of a volume in the library of the Society of Antiquaries, MSS. No.
  41, as will be found on comparison with Sir Henry Ellis's Catalogue of
  that collection, p. 17. The latter is the volume which Oldys, in his life
  of sir John Fastolfe, in the Biographia Britannica 1750, has described at
  p. 1907 as a "quarto book some time in the custody of the late Brian
  Fairfax esquire, one of the Commissioners of the Customs," and of which
  Oldys attributes the collection to the son of William of Worcestre,
  because a dedicatory letter from that person to king Edward the Fourth is
  prefixed to the volume.</p>

  <p>Another very valuable assemblage of papers of the like character, and
  which may also be regarded as part of the papers of sir John Fastolfe, is
  preserved in the College of Arms, MS. Arundel <span
  class="scac">XLVIII.</span>, and is fully described by Mr. W. H. Black in
  his Catalogue of that collection, 8vo. 1829. This is the volume from
  which Hearne derived the Annals of William of Worcestre, and Mr. Benjamin
  Williams one of his chronicles of the reign of Henry the Fifth.</p>

  <p>It is probable that the Lambeth MS. was formerly in the Royal Library,
  for abstracts of some of its more important documents, in the autograph
  of King Edward the Sixth, are preserved in the MS. Cotton. Nero C. x.
  These have been printed in the Literary Remains of King Edward the Sixth,
  pp. 555-560.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt76" href="#NtA76">[76]</a> From the authority of Tanner and
  Oldys, we gather that there was formerly a volume in the library of the
  College of Arms, bearing the following title: "Liber de Actis Armorum et
  Conquestus Regni Franciæ, ducatus Normanniæ, ducatus Alenconiæ, ducatus
  Andegaviæ et Cenomanniæ, &amp;c. Compilatus fuit ad nobilem virum
  Johannem Fastolff, baronem de Cyllye guillem vel Cylly quotem, &amp;c.
  1459, per Pet. Basset armig." (Tanner, Bibliotheca Britannica, 1748, p.
  79; Oldys, Biographia Britannica, 1750, iii. 1903, again, p. 1906; and
  2nd edit. 1793, v. 701.) Both Tanner and Oldys describe this book as
  being in the Heralds' Office at London, but it is not now to be found
  there; and is certainly not a part of the Arundel MS. <span
  class="scac">XLVIII.</span> the contents of which curious and valuable
  volume are minutely described in the Catalogue of the collection by Mr.
  W. H. Black, F.S.A.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt77" href="#NtA77">[77]</a> Bale (Scriptores Brytanniæ, vii.
  80, Folio, 1557, p. 568,) describes Peter Basset as an esquire of noble
  family, and an attendant upon Henry the Fifth in his bedchamber
  throughout that monarch's career. Bale states that this faithful esquire
  wrote the memoirs of his royal master, very fully, from his cradle to his
  grave, in the English language; and we find that the work was known to
  the chronicler Hall, who quotes Basset in regard to the disease of which
  the king died. It is remarkable, however, that this work, like that
  formerly in the College of Arms, mentioned in the preceding note (if it
  were not the same), has now disappeared; and the name of Basset has been
  unknown to Mr. Benjamin Williams and Mr. Charles Augustus Cole, the
  editors of recent collections on the reign of Henry the Fifth for the
  English Historical Society and the series of the present Master of the
  Rolls, (1850 and 1858,) as also to Sir N. Harris Nicolas, the historian
  of the Battle of Agincourt, and the Rev. J. Endell Tyler, the biographer
  of King Henry of Monmouth (2 vols. 8vo. 1838).</p>

  <p><a name="Nt78" href="#NtA78">[78]</a> Its real author is supposed to
  have been Ægidius Romanus, or De Columna, who was bishop of Berri, and
  died in 1316. See Les Manuscrits Francois de la Bibliothèque du Roi, par
  M. Paulin Paris, 1836, i. 224. It was printed at Rome in 1482, and at
  Venice in 1598: see Cave, Historia Literaria, vol. ii. p. 340. Thomas
  Occleve, the contemporary of Chaucer, wrote a poem <i>De Regimine
  Principum</i>, founded, to a certain extent, upon the work of Ægidius,
  but applied to the events of his own time, and specially directed to the
  instruction of the prince of Wales, afterwards King Henry V. The
  Roxburghe Club has recently committed the editorship of this work to Mr.
  Thomas Wright, F.S.A.</p>

  12,) conjectures that this may have been the same with "A Treatise of
  Nobility," by John Clerke, mentioned by Wood, in his Athenæ Oxonienses,
  as being also a translation from the French; this was printed in 12mo,
  1543. (Ath. Oxon. edit. Bliss, i. 205.) In that case the name of
  <i>Larke</i> is an error of Ames.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt81" href="#NtA81">[81]</a> Wyer also printed "The Boke of
  Knowledge," a work on prognostics in physic, and on astronomy (Dibdin's
  Ames, iii. 199, 200), and "The Book of Wysdome, spekyng of vyces and
  vertues, 1532." (ibid. p. 175.)</p>

  <p><a name="Nt83" href="#NtA83">[83]</a> Mr. B. B. Woodward, F.S.A. the
  author of a History of Hampshire now in progress, kindly undertook for me
  to search the records of the city of Winchester in order to discover, if
  possible, any information in elucidation of this document; but he found
  them in so great confusion, that at present it is impossible to pursue
  such an inquiry with any hope of success.</p>
